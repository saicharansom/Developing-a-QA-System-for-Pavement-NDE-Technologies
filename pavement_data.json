        "content": "2D and 3D Imaging Technology (IT) Target of Investigation Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging technologies are used for evaluation and management of surface distress of highway pavements, most commonly in the form of crack mapping. 2D imaging systems have been used to map cracks in highway pavements for two decades but have several limitations. (1) 3D imaging systems overcome these limitations and incorporate depth measurements into pavement surveys. Human observation, which is the most widely used method for evaluating pavement surface distress, is labor intensive, high variability, and hazardous to inspectors performing evaluations. (2) Early observational and imaging surveys were often of poor quality because they lacked consistency, repeatability, and accuracy. (3) Automated 2D and 3D imaging systems have the potential to efficiently provide precise pavement distress evaluations. (3) 2D and 3D imaging can also be used to identify AC longitudinal joints that are displaying deterioration. These technologies have been successfully used to measure faulting as well Description 2D Imaging Systems When mounted on a vehicle, 2D imaging systems (figure 1) map cracks in pavements by capturing images of the pavement along the road being surveyed. Early systems took a series of analog still pictures or continuous-image film of the survey area, and those images were then digitized for further analysis. Those analog systems have been supplanted with more efficient digital cameras.

Photo. Survey vehicle with mounted 2D imaging system. (4) This photo is of the two-dimensional (2D) imaging system. The 2D imaging system is mounted to the rear of the survey vehicle by a steel frame. The laser scanner and receiver are mounted to the top beam of the steel frame and facing the road surface.\" Identification and estimation of the dimensions and distribution of cracks (collectively called crack mapping) work based on the assumption that cracks will manifest as areas that are darker than the surrounding intact pavement. Attempts to fully automate the mapping process of 2D imaging have been hampered by limitations of the quality and resolution of images, limited visibility of cracks on certain pavements, sensitivity to lighting conditions, the presence of shadows, the presence of stains, poor intensity contrast between cracks and pavement, and the inability to evaluate depth parameters. (1) To minimize problems with lighting conditions, linescanning techniques, in which a laser is used to artificially illuminate the surface so that the reflections of the laser beam on the surface are collected in lateral scans, have become more common than the earlier methods for scanning unlit areas. (2) Unfortunately, other problems inherent to 2D imaging systems have not been fully resolved. 3D Imaging Systems 3D imaging systems were developed to reduce the limitations of 2D imaging systems. Research has been done regarding implementing stereovision to develop 3D images. This technique uses two cameras to capture two images of the same location. Computer software produces a 3D image using the sets of pictures by matching the images using common points between them. (3,5) Since this technology still uses 2D images, it allows for evaluating depth parameters while retaining the other features of 2D imaging systems, especially providing uniform light intensity for both images under direct sunlight. (3) Most 3D imaging systems use laser imaging. Two high-performance laser-profiling units are mounted on a vehicle (figure 2). Each profiling unit consists of a 3D laser profiler (laser line projector), custom filter, and area-scan camera employed as a detector. The laser profile projects an image of a laser light strip onto the pavement; the detector captures the image. Based on the calibrated geometry of the system and the deformation of the laser line projected onto the pavement, the elevation of the surface can be estimated by reconstructing a set of 3D points. (6) A complete dataset creates a 3D model of the surface, from which the geometry and dimensions of the surface cracks, including depth parameters, can be estimated using automated or semiautomated software. Some systems are capable of simultaneously collecting 2D and 3D data with a depth resolution of 0.3 mm (0.01 inches) and lateral resolution of 1.0 mm (0.04 inches) while traveling at 60 mph (96 km/h). (3) The clear advantages of 3D laser imaging systems are that they are not sensitive to lighting effects during data collection or affected by either stains on the pavement or poor intensity contrast between the crack and surrounding pavement. (1)\n\u00a9 2012 Springer. Figure 2. Photo. Survey vehicle with mounted 3D imaging system. (6) This photo is of the three-dimensional (3D) imaging system. The 3D imaging system is mounted above the survey vehicle on a steel frame. The system includes two laser profiling units that are placed inside two boxes at the ends of the mounting beam.\" Physical Principle 2D imaging systems use line scanning, which is a tool that allows the operator to consider the resolution both across the pavement (transverse resolution) and along the movement path (longitudinal resolution). The transverse resolution is controlled by the number of pixels in the camera. The longitudinal resolution is a function of the speed of the vehicle and scan rate of the camera. Common line-scan sensors today have more than 10,000 pixels and can scan at rates above 10 kHz. An inspection with a line-scan camera can provide 100-percent coverage of the surface at one predetermined resolution for longitudinal and transverse directions (figure 3). The scan rate of a line-scan camera can be dynamically adjusted to satisfy the requirement of uniform resolution in both directions by transmitting the speed of the vehicle, measured with an encoder, to the camera in real time. With the speed known and resolution fixed, the collected digital information from a line-scan camera along transverse lines are formatted and fed into a processor for image processing. (2)\n\u00a9 2011 Wang, K.C.P. TDI = time-delayed integration. Figure 3. Illustration. Physical principle of 2D line scanning. (2) This illustration is a schematic showing how two-dimensional (2D) line scanning works in application. On top is a detailed illustration of different elements in the 2D imaging system. First, an axle with wheels represents the vehicle, which is moving in a longitudinal direction. A black box labeled \u201cSpeed Encoder\u201d generates and sends the real-time speed of the vehicle through a black wire labeled \u201cExternal sync source\u201d to a video camera labeled \u201cTDI Line-scan.\u201d A sector is sent out by the time-delayed integration (TDI) line scanner and reaches the road surface, representing the line scans. Collected digital transverse lines from the camera are formatted by the system and fed into a processor for image processing. At the bottom of the figure is a van over a flat surface with a gray triangle between the two. The flat surface represents the pavement, and the triangle represents the laser scan.\" 3D laser imaging is based on the triangulation principle. A specific\u2014and often fixed\u2014pattern of illumination, such as a laser line, is projected onto the pavement (figure 4). A digital area-scan camera is placed at a known distance and oblique angle from the light projector. The system has time-delayed integration and uses either a charged coupled device or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor. The camera takes images of the structured light, and the\ndeformations of the laser line on the pavement are analyzed to evaluate the depth (z-axis) for each point at a known horizontal position (x-axis) on the pavement. The system is usually coupled with an encoder to obtain the longitudinal (y-axis) position of each point. \u00a9 2012 ASCE. All rights reserved. \u03b8 = angle between laser diode and CMOS detector centerlines. Figure 4. Illustration. The physical principle of triangulation for 3D imaging. (1) This illustration is a schematic showing three-dimensional imaging based on the triangulation principle. A complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) detector is placed at a known distance and oblique angle with respect to a laser-diode projector. A horizontal line represents the normal depth of the pavement surface, and two horizontal, dashed lines represent varied depths. The distance between the two dashed lines is labeled \u201cMeasurement Range.\u201d The solid line sent out from the laser-diode projector at a diagonal to the pavement surface shows that the laser first goes through one lens, is reflected by the surface, and then detected by the CMOS detector after going through another lens. The solid line reflected by the pavement surface represents the reflection from the surface at the normal depth, and two other solid lines represent the laser reflected by the surface at different depths. The change in the depth can be calculated based on the deviation of the projected laser line on the image.\" Data Acquisition Since there are only a few 2D and 3D imaging systems and they are at various stages of development, data collection procedures are not standardized. At the basic level, instructions and guidelines provided by manufacturers or developers should be followed to establish data collection procedures. The systems should be calibrated prior to data collection. Most systems cover a full lane width. Data are automatically compiled and saved. Depending on the software and automation capabilities, collected data can be processed on site or stored for future processing. Data Processing Most automated processing software packages follow a similar conceptual approach, but the algorithms and processes employed vary from developer to developer. 2D imaging pavement surveys use 8-bit (256 levels of luminance per pixel) images to subjectively determine the dimensions and geometry of cracks (figure 5). That process is affected by the level of uniformity of the width and geometry of a crack. In the processing unit, the 8-bit grayscale images are filtered with customized algorithms to eliminate a large portion of noncracked areas. The remaining visual\ninformation is then converted into a black\u2013white binary format. Noise in the binary images is removed, and the disconnected cracks are linked together. A vectoring analysis can be conducted on the remaining information in the image to obtain geometry data for each crack, including length, width, orientation, and location. These data are then saved. (4) Only a few automated processing systems are available commercially. Some 2D imaging systems provide only images, so those performing the evaluation must obtain processing software. \u00a9 2011 Wang, K.C.P. Figure 5. Photo. 2D grayscale image of a crack. (4) This photo of a cracking pavement was taken by a two-dimensional imaging system. Cracks are shown as darker lines in the grayscale image.\" 3D imaging systems usually include software packages for automated processing of crack mapping (figure 6). Some also allow the user to perform semiautomated analyses. (3) The user should refer to user manuals. \u00a9 2014 Kelvin C.P. Wang. Figure 6. Composite graph. 3D image processing software. (3)\nThis screenshot is of three-dimensional imaging processing software. In the major window on the top right corner, two straps perpendicular to each other each represent a crack, and depths of 26.2 and 43.4 millimeters (0.9 and 1.7 inches) are given. In the window on the left, a grayscale graph of the pavement is shown with a boxed area, which is the targeted area in the main window. Three small windows are shown at the bottom of the screenshot: (1) a perspective view of the pavement, (2) folder files and (3) a graph of the depth profile of the crack in the main window.\" Data Interpretation 2D and 3D imaging systems generate data on surface cracking of pavements. 2D imaging systems provide the crack width, intensity, and distribution (figure 7). 3D imaging systems can potentially provide crack depth parameters (figure 8) in addition to the information provided by 2D imaging systems. The data gathered by both types of systems can be used for pavement distress evaluation and pavement management.\n\u00a9 2012 Springer. Figure 7. Composite image. Mapped pavement cracking.

(3) This composite image of pavement cracks was obtained by three-dimensional imaging. The width, geometry, and depth of the cracks are visible. One crack on the surface is located within a green zone representing the crack depth. A line within the strip shows the depth of the crack from the surface, and a horizontal line is a reference. The greatest depth is 44.2 millimeters (1.75 inches).\" Advantages Advantages of 2D and 3D imaging systems compared to visual observation surveys include the following: More efficient and safer. More comprehensive and quantitative information about distress. Limitations Limitations of 2D and 3D imaging systems include the following: Many systems and methods are at various stages of development. 2D imaging systems are affected by lighting conditions and shadows, nonuniform crack width and geometry, stains on pavement, and poor intensity contrast between cracked and sound pavements. 2D imaging systems do not provide depth measurements.

        "content": "Circular Texture Meter (CTM) Target of Investigation Circular texture meters are laser-based devices for measuring the mean profile depth (MPD) of a pavement at a given location. MPD values obtained from a circular texture meter are highly correlated with mean texture depth (MTD) values and can replace volumetric measurement methods often used to determine MTD. Description A pavement\u2019s surface texture is related to many of its other characteristics. \u201cMicrotexture\u201d includes surface textures with wavelengths of 0.001\u20130.5 mm (0.04\u201320 mils), and \u201cmacrotexture\u201d includes surface textures with wavelengths of 0.5\u201350 mm (20 mils\u20132 inches) (figure 1). (1) Frictional characteristics of a pavement surface are related to both microtexture and macrotexture. Microtexture provides a gritty surface; it can accommodate films of water and produce good frictional resistance between the tire and the pavement. Macrotexture provides drainage channels for water expulsion between the tire and the pavement, allowing better tire contact with the pavement. Macrotexture facilitates improved frictional resistance and prevents hydroplaning. (2) Macrotexture is also related to the level of noise emitted by a pavement. Additionally, it has been used to identify the segregation of the asphalt layer. (3) \u00a9 2013 The Transtec Group, Inc. Figure 1. Photo. Microtexture and macrotexture of an asphalt pavement. (4) This photo shows the microtexture and macrotexture of an asphalt pavement\u2019s surface. The surfaces of the aggregates within three small circles show the magnitude of microtexture. The surface within the dashed ellipsoid, which surrounds the smaller circles, shows the magnitude\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_1.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_3.jpeg]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.jpeg]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_5.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_6.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_7.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_8.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_10.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_11.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_12.png]\nof the macrotexture. A quarter is laid on the pavement surface to compare different magnitudes of microtexture and macrotexture.\" Circular texture meters (figure 2) measure the profile of a circle by using a laser. A circle with 284 mm (11.2 inches) diameter is divided into eight equal segments with curved lengths of 111.5 mm (4.4 inches) (segments A\u2013H in figure 3). The mean segment depth (MSD) is determined for each segment of the circle. The reported MPD is the average of all eight segment depths. Bottom view. This photo shows the bottom of a circular texture meter. A rotation arm is rotating around the center of the circular texture meter.\" \u00a9 2009 AASHTO. B. Application of circular texture meter. Figure 2. Photos. Bottom view and application of a circular texture meter. (5) This photo shows the application of the circular texture meter on a concrete pavement. The circular texture meter is on the pavement and being operated by an individual. A vehicle nearby provides power and houses the devices computer.\" Physical Principle The circular texture meter has a charged coupled device (CCD) laser displacement sensor. A CCD is mounted on a rotating arm 80 mm (3.15 inches) above the pavement surface; the rotation of the arm moves the CCD in a circle with a diameter of 284 mm (11.2 inches). The arm is driven by a motor at a tangential velocity of 6 m/min (19.6 ft/min). The CCD takes a measurement 1,024 times per rotation, providing a sample spacing of 0.87 mm (0.034 inches). The MPD, the root mean square (RMS), or both are computed for each segment.\nSource: FHWA. Figure 3. Illustration. Principle of the circular texture meter. This illustration is a two-dimensional schematic of the working principle of the circular texture meter. An arrow indicates the traffic direction is left to right. The circular path is divided into eight segments labeled \u201cA\u201d through \u201cH,\u201d and each segment covers 45 degrees of the circle. A dot on the arc labeled \u201cC\u201d represents a charged coupled device\u2019s laser displacement sensor, which rotates counterclockwise around the center of the meter in a circular path.\" Data Acquisition ASTM E2157-15, Standard Test Method for Measuring Pavement Macrotexture Properties Using the Circular Track Meter, covers the procedure for obtaining and analyzing pavement macrotexture profiles using a circular texture meter. (6) The circular texture meter is placed on a dry, clean, and homogeneous area of the pavement surface. The circular texture meter is oriented with segments C and G in line with the direction of traffic (figure 3). A computer controls the data collection process and monitors, saves, and processes the collected data. As soon as the measurement is initiated via the computer, a direct current motor drives the arm for a full 360degree revolution, records the data, and estimates the profile of each of the eight segments for analysis. Data Processing Computer software can process the data to report either the MPD (in accordance with ASTM E1845) or the RMS. (7) For each test site, invalid readings caused by deep surface troughs or local photometric properties of the surface are eliminated when their value is higher or lower than the profile range for nearby locations. The invalid value for a location is replaced with one interpolated from the values at the previous and next locations. Highfrequency components that correspond to texture wavelengths less than 2.5 mm (0.098 inches) are removed to reduce the influence of noise and transients, leading to a relatively uniform influence of narrow profile peaks. For each segment, a linear regression of the estimated profile values is performed. The regression line is subtracted from the profile values of the segment to translate the data to a 0 mean. Each segment is further divided into two subsegments with equal lengths, and the maximum value of the profile is determined for each subsegment. These two values are averaged to obtain the MSD (figure 4). The average of the MSD values for all eight segments represents the MPD. Figure 5 illustrates the calculation of the RMS of each segment of the profile in figure 4.\n\u00a9 2011 The Transtec Group, Inc. 1 mm = 0.039 inches. Figure 4. Graph. Calculation of the MSD for each segment. (8) This graph illustrates the calculation of the mean segment depth (MSD) for each segment of the circular texture meter. The x-axis, which is divided into two halves, represents the length of the segment. The y-axis represents the profile depth in millimeters. A curve on the chart is the measured profile. Peak 1, from the first half of the segment, measures 0.55 millimeters. Peak 2, from the second half of the segment, measures 0.83 millimeters. The MSD is the average of peaks 1 and 2, which is 0.69 millimeters.\n\u00a9 2011 The Transtec Group, Inc. 1 mm = 0.039 inches. Figure 5. Graph. Calculation of the RMS for each segment of the profile in figure 4. (8) This graph illustrates the calculation of the root mean square (RMS) for the profile shown in figure 4. The x-axis is the length of the segment. The y-axis is the square of the profile. The area under the curve represents the square of the profile at each location of the segment. There are three distinct peaks where the square of the profile reaches approximately 4.1, 2, and 3.75 square millimeters.\" Data Interpretation Comparison of MPD and RMS values for a surface provides information on the nature of the texture. Profiles from individual segments can be used to examine the surface texture in different directions (e.g., parallel or perpendicular to the direction of travel). Figure 6 shows pavement texture categories and their effects on surface characteristics. Large MPD and/or RMS values indicate coarse macrotexture, which is good for wet weather friction and traffic noise (airpumping noise) but will cause more tire wear, traffic noise (tire\u2013pavement noise), and rolling resistance.\n\u00a9 2013 The Transtec Group, Inc. 1 \u00b5m = 0.039 mils; 1 mm = 0.039 inches; 1 m = 3.3 ft. PIARC = World Road Association. Figure 6. Chart. Pavement texture categories and their effect on surface characteristics. (4) This chart illustrates the relationship between surface texture magnitude and pavement surface characteristics. The x-axis is the surface texture wavelength, ranging from 1 micrometer to 100 meters, and is divided, from left to right, into four sections: microtexture, macrotexture, megatexture, and roughness. Most characteristics span at least two of these categories. Microtexture includes dry weather friction and tire wear. Macrotexture includes dry weather friction, tire wear, wet weather friction, splash and spray, tire\u2013pavement noise, rolling resistance, and in-vehicle noise. Megatexture includes tire\u2013pavement noise, rolling resistance, in-vehicle noise, ride quality, and vehicle wear. Roughness includes rolling resistance, ride quality, and vehicle wear. A scale labels the characteristics as good or bad. Good characteristics include dry weather friction, wet weather friction, and splash and spray. Tire\u2013pavement noise is roughly neutral. Bad characteristics include tire wear, in- vehicle noise, vehicle wear, ride quality, and rolling resistance.\" Advantages Measuring surface texture with a circular texture meter has the following advantages: (5) Results are repeatable and reproducible. MPD correlates well with MTD. Positive and negative textures are measurable. Equipment is portable. Setup time is short. Limitations Measuring surface texture with a circular texture meter has the following limitations: (5) The method is slow and requires lane closure. Each test result only represents a small surface area. Results do not reflect full-scale tire behavior.\nReferences World Road Association (PIARC). (1987). Report of the Committee on Surface 1.

        "content": "Electrical Resistivity (ER) Target of Investigation Electrical resistivity can be used to determine the following: Reinforced concrete\u2019s susceptibility to corrosion. Regions susceptible to moisture and chloride penetration. Resistivity measurement can be used in tandem with other corrosion assessment techniques such as half-cell potential, which identifies corrosion activity, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of corrosion. Description The presence and concentration of water, chlorides, salts, and other corrosive substances significantly contribute to a corrosive environment in concrete. The electrical resistivity method can be used to evaluate the existence of such corrosive environment. Damaged and cracked areas, due to increased porosity, will form preferential paths for fluid and ion flow. This will lead to higher moisture and chloride concentrations and higher concrete electrical conductivity, manifesting as a lower electrical resistivity. The lower the electrical resistivity of the concrete, the higher the current passing between anodic and cathodic areas of the reinforcement steel will be. (1) Several studies have established approximate relationships between the electrical resistivity and the corrosion rate of steel reinforcement (table 1). Table 1. Electrical Resistivity and Corresponding Corrosion Rates for Steel-reinforced Concrete. (1) Electrical Resistivity (K\u03a9*cm) Corrosion Rate < 5 Very High 5 - 10 High 10 - 20 Moderate - Low > 20 Low The Wenner probe is a commonly used electrical resistivity probe (figure 1). The probe has four electrodes. Figure 2 shows electrical resistivity measurement being conducted on a concrete bridge deck.\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_6.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_9.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_10.png]\nFigure 1.

The horizontal probe has four electrodes extending from the bottom of the probe to the surface. Figure 2. Photo. Conducting Electrical Resistivity Measurement. (2) Physical Principle Electrical resistivity or its reciprocal, electrical conductivity, is an intrinsic property that quantifies the ability of a given material to oppose or conduct electric current. The standard SI unit of electrical resistivity is ohm-meter (\u03a9-m) although other units like ohm-centimeter (\u03a9-cm) are also\nused. Surface electrical resistivity of a steel-reinforced concrete element (typically, the cover of a steel-reinforced concrete slab or deck) is an indicator of concrete corrosive environment. To conduct electrical resistivity tests, the voltage and current are measured at the surface of the object under investigation using a certain layout of electrodes. The most simple and common electrode layout in civil engineering applications is the Wenner array (figure 3). The Wenner array uses four in-line electrodes that are equally spaced. (1) A current is applied between the two outer electrodes, and the potential is measured across the two inner ones. The resistivity is then calculated (figure 4). Figure 3. Illustration. Physical Principle of Electrical Resistivity Measurement. (1) Conducting Electrical Resistivity Measurement. A worker is standing on a concrete bridge deck. The worker\u2019s right hand is holding a shaft that is attached to a probe in contact with the deck. The worker\u2019s left hand is holding a small instrument outputting data from the probe. The instrument is hanging from a sling around the worker\u2019s neck. Figure 4. Equation. Electrical Resistivity. (2) Physical Principle of Electrical Resistivity Measurement. The two-dimensional schematic shows a Wenner probe resting on a thick concrete surface. The view of the surface is a cut-away from the side. The probe has four, equally-spaced electrodes. A current, I, is applied between the two outermost electrodes. Current flow is depicted by curved lines dipping into the surface from one of the outermost electrodes and rising to the other outermost electrode. Voltage, V, is measured across the two inner electrodes. Curving lines descending from the top of the deck into the interior and then rising back to the top are labeled Iso-potential lines. Where: \u03c1 = Resistivity (\u03a9-m or \u03a9-cm). \u03b1 = Electrode separation (m). V = Voltage (V). I = Current (amp).\nBuilding materials such as concrete, cement, or wood are ion conductors, which means that electrical conduction happens through the interconnected pore space. The resistivity of fully saturated concrete is between 1 and 10 k\u2126-cm, depending on the conductivity of the pore fluid. When concrete is oven dried, its electrical resistivity can be 100 k\u2126-cm or more, causing it to act as an insulator. The electrical resistivity of concrete affects the ionic current flow between the anode and cathode and the rate at which corrosion can occur. Dry concrete has high electrical resistivity and, thus, will impede the current flow and inhibit corrosion, whereas highly permeable and moist concrete has low electrical resistivity and a high likelihood of corrosion. As concrete is a composite material, its electrical resistivity will always depend upon its porosity, pore size distribution, cement chemistry, water/cement ratio, and types and concentrations of admixtures. The resistivity is also a function of the ion type and content of the saturation fluid. (3,4). Drying the concrete surface, carbonation, and the presence of steel reinforcement in the vicinity of the electrodes significantly affect resistivity measurements. Data Acquisition Currently, there is no ASTM or other standard for measuring resistivity of concrete using a Wenner array. ASTM G57-06, Standard Test Method for Field Measurement of Soil Resistivity Using the Wenner Four-Electrode Method, is a similar application to concrete testing, but there are differences. For electrical resistivity measurements, galvanic contact has to be ensured between the electrodes and the concrete. If the surface of concrete is dry, the concrete has to be pre-wetted with water, contact graphite gel, or pastes, or the electrodes must be kept moist. The following steps explain the general procedure for electrical resistivity measurements: A 2-ft by 2-ft survey grid is laid out on the surface of concrete deck. Each grid point is used as the central point of a Wenner probe. The sponges on all four electrodes are fully saturated with soapy water to assure electrical coupling between the electrodes and concrete. The spots for electrodes sitting on a concrete surface are wetted by soapy water before the electrodes are placed on it to ensure good contact between the electrodes and the concrete surface. The key is to keep the sponges wet all the times. The resistivity values are measured and stored in a control unit. Data Processing Data processing is simple and consists of generating a contour map of the measured electrical resistivity data to report the spatial distribution of the resistivity values. Data Interpretation Areas with low resistivity describe highly corrosive environment facilitating high corrosion rates, whereas areas with a high resistivity describe an environment that does not facilitate corrosion. In Figure 5, the electrical resistivity is correlated to the corrosion rate according to Table 1 (See Description).\nFigure 5. Contour Map. Electrical Resistivity Measurements. (2) Electrical Resistivity. Rho (resistivity) equals the quotient of two times pi times alpha (electrode separation) times V (voltage), divided by I (current). Advantages Low to medium level of expertise required for equipment setup and data collection. Low-cost testing. Simple data processing and presentation. Testing is repeatable with low coefficient of variation. Limitations Not a direct measurement of corrosion, like corrosion rate or corrosion activity. Time consuming and labor intensive on large bridge decks since data collection is often done manually. Challenging data interpretation since ER is impacted by a number of environmental parameters (e.g., moisture and salt content, porosity), and their impacts on the measured data cannot be delineated. Measurements on concrete elements with electrically isolating coatings or overlays, like asphalt overlays on bridge decks, provide meaningless results.

        "content": "Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) Target of Investigation The falling weight deflectometer (FWD) (figure 1) is a nondestructive testing device widely used in pavement engineering to evaluate a pavement\u2019s structural condition and assess its capability of handling future traffic loads. The FWD plays a crucial role in selecting optimum pavement maintenance and rehabilitation strategies. The heavyweight deflectometer (HWD) is a type of FWD that can apply a heavier load to the pavement; it is mostly used for airport airfield applications. The lightweight deflectometer is another version of the FWD that can apply a lighter load for evaluation of subgrade moduli. The light weight deflectometer (LWD) can be used to evaluate unbound bases. Source: FHWA. Figure 1. Photo. An FWD in operation.

(1) FWDs can be used for multiple pavement applications, including the following: Estimation of pavement layer moduli. Evaluation of a pavement\u2019s structural condition. Detection of voids beneath concrete pavements. Determination of joint load-transfer efficiency (LTE). The in situ estimation of parameters such as the stiffness and pavement layer moduli is necessary for assessing the condition of the pavement as a system or layer by layer. For rehabilitation purposes, FWDs can also provide information on loss of support (voids) under concrete pavements. For joint LTE testing, one of the sensors is placed behind the load plate. FWDs are used for a number of other applications that are less common but documented in the literature. (2) Description A schematic and picture of an FWD sensor configuration are shown in figure 2.

(3) Note: Sensors can be placed in different spacing. Figure 2. Illustrations. FWD sensor configurations. By dropping a weight, an FWD generates a load pulse with a nominal duration of 30\u201360 ms. (2) The load pulse is transmitted to the pavement through a circular load plate that is typically 300\u2013450 mm (12\u201318 inches) in diameter. The peak force that an FWD plate exerts on the pavement surface varies by the drop height and weight and can be as high as 100 kN (22 kips). An HWD can\nexert in excess of 300 kN (66 kips). A load cell mounted on top of the load plate measures the load imparted to the pavement surface. The outer FWD geophones are used to assess stiffness of the subgrade while those close to the center of the load measure the entire pavement response. The load pulse deforms the pavement in the vicinity of the load plate into a shape that resembles a bowl. Sensors, such as geophones or seismometers, are mounted radially from the center of the load plate to measure pavement velocity or acceleration that is then integrated to get deflections.. The distances from the center of the load plate to the sensors are adjustable. The nominal standard sensor spacing is 300 mm (12 inches), as shown in figure 2. However, some agencies (e.g., Federal Highway Administration\u2019s [FHWA\u2019s] Long-Term Pavement Performance Program [LTPP]) may use different sensor configurations. (2). For joint LTE testing, one of the sensors is placed behind the load plate. The applied force and measured deflections along the deflection bowl can be used to estimate the stiffness parameters of the pavement system as a whole or the moduli of different pavement layers and the subgrade using various computational methods. Physical Principle Figure 3 illustrates typical deflection responses from loading on a flexible pavement and the interior regions (i.e., those away from the joints) of a rigid pavement. The shape of the deflection bowl allows for structural analysis of the pavement. A broad bowl with little curvature indicates the pavement\u2019s upper layers are stiff in relation to the subgrade. Conversely, a bowl with the same central deflection but a high curvature around the loading plate indicates the moduli of the upper layers are relatively low. (2) Source: FHWA.A. Flexible pavement.

Rigid pavement. The response close to a crack or joint is different than those away from those elements. As shown in figure 4, the traffic load imposed on one side of a joint or crack of a rigid pavement may induce deformation on the other side because of load transfer. Both loaded and unloaded slabs deflect because a portion of the load applied to the loaded slab is transferred to the unloaded slab. (4,5) Source: FHWA.Dl = loaded deflection;Du= unloaded deflection.1 mm = 0.039 inches.A. No load transfer This diagram is a two-dimensional schematic illustrating the case of no load transfer at a joint. Two blocks represent the loaded and the unloaded slabs.

Since the two slabs are totally separated, the loaded slab has a deflection of 0.66 millimeters at the joint and the unloaded slab has no deflection at all. \"/>Source: FHWA.Dl = loaded deflection;Du= unloaded deflection.1 mm = 0.039 inches.A.

Response of rigid pavements at joints and cracks.(6)\nThis diagram is a two-dimensional schematic illustrating the case of full load transfer at the joint. The two slabs are connected by a dowel at the joint. The slab on the left is the loaded slab, and the slab on the right is the unloaded slab. A tire representing the vehicle load is on top of the loaded slab. Both slabs have a deflection of 0.33 millimeters at the joint. FWD testing that shows areas of high deflection at the edge of a concrete slab may be an indication of a void. Voids are generally created below slab corners because of pumping and erosion of subbase/subgrade material from repeated loading cycles. (7) Voids represent an area of poor support, which can lead to accelerated cracking and other distresses. (2) Data Acquisition ASTM D4694-09 and the LTPP Manual for Falling Weight Deflectometer Measurements contain procedures for performing FWD testing on pavements. (8,4) Generally, a vehicle or trailer with the FWD system is brought to a stop, and its loading plate is positioned over the test location. The deflection sensors are lowered to the pavement surface remotely. Several series of tests with the same or different nominal loads are then performed. As the load is applied to the pavement, the deflection sensors and load cell measure the load- and deflection-time histories. After the test is finished at one location, the device is moved to the next test location. A data acquisition system usually initiates data collection and storage automatically. According to the LTPP Manual for Falling Weight Deflectometer Measurements, data for joint LTE evaluations must be collected by first placing the plate on one side of the joint and then on the other to measure the deflections on both slabs, as shown in figure 5. (4) For this application, a trailing deflection sensor (marked as D9) is necessary. Source: FHWA.D = deflection sensor.A. Configuration for approach testing. Figure 5. Diagrams. Configurations for joint LTE testing. (4) This diagram shows the configuration for approach testing: the direction of traffic is to the right, the approach slab is on the left, and the selected slab is on the right. The load cell and sensor D9 are sitting on top of the approach slab, and sensors D2 and D3 are sitting on top of the selected slab. Source: FHWA.D = deflection sensor.B. Configuration for leave testing. This diagram shows the configuration for leave testing: the direction of traffic is to the right, the approach slab is on the left and the selected slab is on the right. Sensor D9 is sitting on top of the approach slab, and the load cell and sensors D2 and D3 are sitting on top of the selected slab.\nFor void detection, the LTPP Manual for Falling Weight Deflectometer Measurements recommends corner testing be performed in the same manner as the joint testing, except that the load plate should be tangent to both the joint or crack that defines the approach end of the slab and the longitudinal joint that defines the outside edge of the slab. (4) At least three different load levels should be used. It is extremely important to calibrate the FWD regularly to ensure proper operation and, when an agency utilizes several FWD units, the interchangeability of data. Data Processing Two FHWA documents related to proper use and processing of FWD data are excellent sources of information. (2,9) FWD data processing varies with the type of pavement and the intended use of the processed data. In some cases, the process may require an experienced analyst. On this web page, data processing for the following four applications is discussed: Estimation of moduli of different pavement layers. Evaluation of a pavement\u2019s structural condition. Detection of voids beneath concrete pavements. Determination of joint LTE. Estimation of Moduli of Different Pavement Layers In general terms, the estimation of layer moduli is usually carried out through a backcalculation process. Since a closed-form solution is not available for multilayer pavement systems, the backcalculation process is usually iterative. As shown in figure 6, the backcalculation process consists of assigning an initial modulus (seed value) to each layer, developing a numerical deflection basin (surface deflections at several radial distances from an applied load) from the assumed moduli, comparing the experimental and theoretical deflection basins, and adjusting the moduli of different layers iteratively until the difference between the experimental and numerical basins is below an acceptable threshold. To implement this strategy in an automated manner, the backcalculation process consists of the following two components: an algorithm to numerically calculate the deflection basin(forward model) and an algorithm to adjust the assumed moduli to minimize the differences between the measured and calculated deflection basins (optimization algorithm).\n\u00a9 2010 Animesh Das.E = layer moduli. Figure 6. Illustration. Schematic diagram of a classical backcalculation process. 10 This illustration shows the backcalculation process. The most common forward models used for flexible pavements are based on the linear-elastic layered concept. For rigid pavements, models are based on Westergaard\u2019s solution for interior loading of a linear-elastic plate resting on a dense liquid foundation. The report Using Falling Weight Deflectometer Data with Mechanistic-Empirical Design and Analysis contains thorough explanations of these models and available software packages that implement them. (2) The LTPP Manual for Falling Weight Deflectometer Measurements mentions other advanced algorithms that consider the dynamic nature of FWD loading and the nonlinear and/or viscoelastic nature of the pavement materials. (4) These algorithms usually require the use of advanced numerical models, such as finite element models. Most optimization or error-minimization algorithms are based on the generalized inversion technique found in many textbooks. (11) The generalized inversion technique assumes a linear relationship between perturbation in the moduli of the layers and the resulting change in the deflection basin. The partial derivative for each layer modulus estimates the change in that parameter for the next iteration. When there is a sharp contrast between the properties of two adjacent layers, nonlinear minimization techniques are conceptually preferred even though they are not as computationally efficient as the generalized inversion technique. (12) The use of artificial neural networks or genetic algorithms may also accelerate the inversion process. These approaches are effective when the profile contains only a few uniform layers. One main concern with the backcalculation of moduli is the nonuniqueness of the solution; that is, many different combinations of layer moduli may result in almost identical deflection basins. The\npresence of a rigid layer or water table in shallow depths (less than 6 m [20 ft]), will negatively impact the backcalculated moduli if not taken into consideration. For these reasons, it is of utmost importance that analysts use their experience and engineering judgement. Evaluation of a Pavement\u2019s Structural Condition The evaluation of a pavement structure, especially at the network level, is sometimes carried out using processes that do not require backcalculation. One method, sometimes referred to as forward calculation, assumes the pavement is a single-layer homogeneous half-space. Based on this assumption, the Boussinesq closed-form solution can be used to determine the surface modulus for each test point. (2,8) The higher the surface modulus is, the stiffer the overall pavement section will be. Another common approach is the use of deflection indices. (13\u201315) Some of the more common indices are included in table 1. The appropriate use of these parameters is discussed in a number of documents, including several papers by Horak and his colleagues. (13\u201315) Table 1. Deflection indices used in pavement structural evaluation.

Determination of Joint LTE The LTE of a joint is calculated via equation 9. (9) Where:\nDu = deflection of the unloaded (leave) slab. Dl = deflection of the loaded (approach) slab. \u03b2 = slab-bending correction factor Parameter \u03b2 is the ratio of deflection in center of loading to deflection at 12 inches (304 mm) from the center with typical values between 1.05 and 1.15; it can usually be ignored. (2) These calculations can be performed by dropping the weight on the approach side of the joint, leave side of the joint, or both. Detection of Voids Beneath Concrete Pavements The presence of voids is determined by measuring deflections at the slab corner using a series of load levels. As shown in figure 7, the potential for voids is determined by extrapolating the best\u2011fit line through the test results to determine the y-intercept (D0). The potential for the presence of voids exists when D0is greater than 0.003 inches (0.0762 mm). (16) Source: FHWA.1 mil = 0.0254 mm; 1 lbf = 4.45 N. Figure 7. Graph. Existence of voids based on D0. LTE equals beta times the quotient of open parenthesis D subscript u divided by D subscript l close parenthesis times 100. Data Interpretation Depending on the project, the interpretation of the processed data can be straightforward or complex. In project-level studies, the backcalculated moduli are used either directly or after adjustment to estimate the remaining pavement life or to develop a rehabilitation strategy using a design algorithm. (2,8) Because of the empirical or mechanistic\u2013empirical nature of estimating design algorithms, adjustment factors vary from algorithm to algorithm. One should become intimately familiar with such algorithms before using the backcalculated moduli. For network-level studies, it is more common to use measured deflections (especially central deflections), forward calculation using the Boussinesq closed-form solution, or one or more indices like those shown in table 1. These methods are usually combined with a statistical approach to categorize pavement sections by stiffness. Another use of the indices is to determine which layer in the pavement is potentially contributing to the distress. The criteria to make such analyses vary vastly among different agencies. (13\u201315) Advantages Advantages of FWDs include the following:\nIs widely used in pavement engineering to evaluate a pavement\u2019s structural condition. Enables rapid, nondestructive structural evaluation of pavements. Provides repeatable and reproducible results with regular calibration. Limitations Limitations of FWDs include the following: Provides a nonunique solution of the backcalculated moduli, especially for multiple unknown layers. Requires traffic control or lane closure.

        "content": "Galvanostatic Pulse Measurement (GPM) Target of Investigation GPM is used to estimate the corrosion rate of steel in steel-reinforced concrete structures. The corrosion rate is very important for determining how fast a concrete member is deteriorating; this determination is not possible with either the ER or HCP technologies. GPM is also advantageous in corrosion risk assessment over HCP measurement in situations when concrete is wet, dense, or polymer-modified, and thus the access to oxygen is limited. (1) Description GPM is an electrochemical NDE technology used for rapid assessment of rebar corrosion, primarily to estimate the corrosion rate for steel rebars. GPM is based on the polarization of rebar using a small current pulse and measurement in the potential change. (2) GPM uses an electrode device positioned on a concrete surface and a reference electrode attached directly to the steel reinforcement to determine the half-cell potential, corrosion rate, and resistance between the reinforcement and device (figure 1).

Physical Principle The GPM corrosion assessment is based on the measurement of the current required to change the potential difference between the reinforcement and a standard reference electrode. The current is a result flow of electrons from the anodic and cathodic sides in concrete. The anodic side is a corroding rebar where there is surplus of electrons on the base metal as a result of releasing metal ions into an electrolytically conducting liquid. Those excess electrons flow to a cathodic side, concrete with oxidizing agents in the liquid, inducing a corrosion current between the two sides. Knowing the current and voltage allows an inspector to determine the polarization resistance, which is related to the rate of corrosion. The GPM test is conducted by first applying to counter electrode a number of anodic DC pulses (5-400\u00b5A). The first, stronger pulse is between 3 to 60 seconds, and its intensity will primarily depend on the properties of the object under investigation. Several smaller consecutive pulses of gradually increased intensity may follow the first pulse. The objective of applying DC pulses is to obtain a sufficiently high polarization, at which point potential variations are recorded by means of a reference electrode (figure 2). Noncorroding or passive reinforcement possesses no current and thus will have a high resistance to current flow which is reflected in a potential shift of around 100 mV. (3) Active corrosion is likely when the potential shift gets smaller. This can be also explained as an actively corroding system can quickly compensate for a removal of electrons due to the corrosion reaction or polarization achieved by the current pulse remains low in an actively corroding area.\nFigure 2. Composite Graph. Galvanostatic Pulse Measurement of Corrosion Activity. This figure consists of two graphics. The graph on the top is a two-dimensional side view of a portion of a concrete slab. Two horizontal rebars, one above the other, are embedded in the slab. The left portion of the upper rebar is labeled \u201cSound Rebar.\u201d A portion of the right side of the upper rebar is labeled \u201cCorrosion Activity.\u201d Two galvanostatic pulse method probes are resting on the upper surface of the slab. Each probe\u2019s dampened sponge is in contact with the slab. The probe on the left is above the sound portion of the rebar. The probe on the right is above the portion of rebar labeled \u201cCorrosion Activity.\u201d The graph at the bottom compares the effect of corrosion on a test current from a galvanostatic pulse method probe. The y-axis of the graph is potential in millivolts. The x-axis is location. The location corresponding to the noncorroded sound rebar shows higher potential than the location corresponding to the rebar with corrosion activity. Data Acquisition For data collection using the galvanostatic pulse method on concrete pavement, follow the procedure described in ASTM C876-09, Standard Test Method for Corrosion Potentials of Uncoated Reinforcing Steel in Concrete. The procedure is summarized as follows: (4) Identify points or lay out a grid for data collection on the pavement, ensuring that points are 1. not so close together that measurements overlap and are not so far apart that localized corrosion is missed. Electrically connect the reinforcing steel to the positive lead of the system (figure 3). The 2. following are typical steps to accomplish this procedure: Locate the steel using a rebar locator, drill down to the reinforcement, and connect a a. lead wire to the steel using a self-tapping screw drilled into the rebar. Ensure all measurement locations are electrically continuous with this tap. b. Confirm that the entire survey area is covered; this may require multiple taps and c. corresponding measurement areas. \u00a9 2015 N. Gucunski/Rutgers CAIT. Figure 3. Photo. Electrical connection to exposed reinforcement steel. (1) This photo shows the connection of a galvanostatic pulse method device to an exposed rebar. An alligator clamp is attached to the rebar. A small cable connects the clamp to the device, which is sitting on the concrete surface.\nElectrically connect the reference electrode to the negative lead of the system. 3. Wet the contact sponge of the reference and counter electrodes to ensure good electrical 4. contact with the concrete pavement; prewetting can also be used if conditions allow. The following steps describe the prewetting process: Wet the entire surface of the testing locations but make sure no free surface water a. remains between test locations before taking measurements. Place a prewetted sponge on each test location before taking measurements and leave it b. in place for the duration of collection at that location. Place the reference electrode on the test point (figure 4). 5. \u00a9 2015 N. Gucunski/Rutgers CAIT. Figure 4. Photo. Data collection with galvanostatic pulse system. The photo shows an operator placing a galvanostatic pulse probe on a concrete surface for data collection. The probe\u2019s wet sponge is in contact with the concrete surface. Adjust the current pulse amplitude with one strong and then several shorter pulses until the 6. reinforcing steel reaches a sufficiently high polarization. Record the potential variations using a handheld computer with data acquisition software. 7. Move to the next test point and repeat the collection procedure. 8. After testing is completed, patch all tap locations. 9. Data Processing Typically, no processing is performed for data collected using the galvanostatic pulse method. The system usually has contour-mapping software for gridding and plotting data for visualization purposes. The slope of the potential\u2013time curve measured during the current pulse can be used to provide information about the corrosion state of the steel reinforcement, and the potential data can be used to obtain a measure of the concrete ER for a given concrete cover depth. Data Interpretation Figure 5 and figure 6 are typical contour maps from a galvanostatic pulse method survey. Figure 5 is an ER map that shows values ranging from 5 to 63 k\u03a9. Areas with lower ER values indicate a higher probability of a corrosive environment from the intrusion of moisture, chlorides, and salts in the concrete. Areas with higher ER values indicate a noncorrosive environment.\n\u00a9 2015 TRB. 1 ft = 0.3 m. Figure 5. Contour map. Concrete ER from a galvanostatic pulse method survey. (5) This contour map shows the concrete electrical resistance measured by the galvanostatic pulse method. A grid overlays the map. The x-axis is length in feet, ranging from 1 to 18. The y-axis is width in feet, ranging from 1 to 7. The entire graph is color-coded to indicate electrical resistivity in kilohms. The left side has high resistivity and is labeled \u201cHigh.\u201d The highest measurement, which covers much of the graph between x equals 1 and x equals 9, ranges from 52 to 63 kilohms. The right side has low resistivity and is labeled \u201cLow.\u201d The lowest measurement, which covers much of the graph between x equals 10 and x equals 14, ranges from 5 to 17 kilohms. From the corrosion rate, cross section loss can be estimated using Faraday\u2019s law of electrochemical equivalent. Figure 6 shows cross section loss assuming that a corrosion rate of 1 \u03bcA/cm 2 (6.45 \u03bcA/inch 2) corresponds to a cross section loss of about 11.6 \u03bcm/yr (0.457mils/yr) for carbon steel. \u00a9 2015 TRB. 1 ft = 0.3 m; 1 \u03bcm = 0.039 mils. Note: Black indicates no data for those areas. Figure 6. Contour map. Estimated section loss based on corrosion rates from a galvanostatic pulse method survey. (5) This contour map shows the corrosion rate of steel reinforcement measured by the galvanostatic pulse method. A grid overlays the map. The x- axis is length in feet, ranging from 1 to 18. The y-axis is width in feet, ranging from 1 to 7. The entire graph is color-coded to indicate the corrosion rate in micrometers per year. The left side has high corrosion rate and is labeled \u201cHigh.\u201d The highest measurement, which covers a small area centered on x equals 4 and y equals 4, ranges from 150 to 500 micrometers per year. The right side of the graph has low corrosion rates and is labeled \u201cLow.\u201d The lowest measurement, which covers much of the graph between x equals 9 and x equals 18, ranges from 0 to 5 micrometers per year. The obtained corrosion rate is an instantaneous average value. A more detailed knowledge of the daily and seasonal changes in the corrosion rate is required to obtain lifetime predictions of service\nlife and condition. The data obtained from the galvanostatic pulse method survey should be combined with data from other nondestructive tests and other investigations to determine concrete integrity and penetration rates. (1) Advantages Advantages of the galvanostatic pulse method include the following: Calculates reinforcement steel corrosion rates. Obtains HCP and ER measurements. Requires low to medium level of expertise to operate data collection equipment. Does not require much data processing. Limitations Limitations of the galvanostatic pulse method include the following: Requires electrical connectivity to reinforcing steel throughout test area. Gives unstable measurements when ER of the concrete cover is high. (1) Requires a few minutes for stabilization of potential before measurements can be recorded. (1) Is time consuming and labor intensive for large survey areas. Cannot be used with epoxy-coated reinforcing steel.

        "content": "Georgia Faultmeter (GFM) Target of Investigation A faultmeter is used to measure joint faulting and lane\u2013shoulder dropoffs in jointed concrete pavements. Description Faulting, which is the difference in elevation on either side of a joint or crack in a concrete surface, is usually caused by pumping, settlement, curling, and warping. Faulting is noticeable when the average difference in elevations of a pavement section reaches about 2.54 mm (0.1 inches). Faulting contributes to the roughness that adversely affects the ride quality of a pavement. Lane\u2013shoulder dropoff refers to the difference in the elevation between the edge of a slab of pavement and the outside shoulder, which typically occurs when the outside shoulder settles. A faultmeter is employed to measure the magnitude of the faulting or lane\u2013shoulder dropoff. As shown in figure 1, the faultmeter is portable and supplies a digital readout with the push of a button located on the carrying handle. The unit measures faulting in about 1 s, then the measurement is saved on the display so that the operator can read it in a safe manner (i.e., off the road). Source: FHWA. Figure 1. Photo. The Georgia Faultmeter in use. (1) This photo shows an operator using a Georgia Faultmeter. The operator is holding the faultmeter down to the pavement. One side of the faultmeter is on the concrete pavement, and the other side is in contact with the shoulder. Physical Principle The Georgia Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of Materials and Research originally designed and developed the Georgia Faultmeter (GFM). (2) There are two versions of the GFM. Manual GFMs use dial gauges to determine the difference between the elevations of the two sides of a crack or joint (figure 2), whereas automated GFMs use linear variable differential transformers to calculate the difference. (3) Any slab that is higher on the approach side of the joint than the leave side registers a positive faulting number. If the slab on the leave side of the joint is higher than the approach side, the meter gives a negative reading.\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.png]\nSource: FHWA. Figure 2. Diagram. Manual faulting measurement using the GFM. (3) This schematic illustrates how to use a faultmeter. It presents a cross section view of a pavement structure. The surface layer of the pavement is divided into sections around two transverse joints. There is an approach slab and a leave slab for each joint. Below the surface layer, the base, subbase, and subgrade of the pavement are labeled. Two faults in the transverse direction are labeled fault 1 and fault 2. The traffic direction flows to the right. A Georgia Faultmeter is straddling the approach and leave slabs over transverse joint 1. It is being used to measure fault 1. Fault 1 is positive; the approach slab is higher than the leave slab. Fault 2 is negative; the approach slab is lower than the leave slab. Data Acquisition The step-by-step process for collecting data with a faultmeter is provided in the Distress Identification Manual for the Long-Term Pavement Performance Program. (1) To begin the process, the joint must be centered between the guidelines on the side of the meter. The legs of the faultmeter\u2019s base should be set on the slab in the direction of traffic on the leave side of the joint. The measuring probe will contact the slab on the approach side. Three measurements are taken at each testing location; the operator chooses one value to use. This representative value is recorded to the nearest millimeter. In cases of a widened lane, the measurement should be taken approximately 0.3 m (1 ft) from the edge of the slab and 0.75 m (2.5 ft) from the outside edge of the edgeline. When anomalies, such as patching, spalling, and corner breaks, are encountered, the faultmeter should be offset to avoid such anomalies in the readings. The maximum offset is 0.3 m (1 ft). A null value should be recorded and entered into the database when the surveyor is unable to take a measurement from an anomaly. Lane\u2013shoulder dropoffs are measured as the difference in elevation, between the pavement surface and the adjacent shoulder surface. Measurements are taken at the beginning of the test section and at intervals at the lane\u2013shoulder interface or joint. Where no lane\u2013shoulder dropoff exists, a measurement of 0 is recorded. Data Processing Data from a faultmeter do not require much processing. The readings and test locations should be recorded in a tabular form. Data Interpretation If the approach slab is higher than the departure slab, the faulting should be recorded as positive; if the approach slab is lower than the departure slab, the faulting should be recorded as negative.\nAdvantages Advantages of faultmeters include the following: Operation is quick and easy at each test location. Data are easy to process and interpret. Limitations Limitations of faultmeters include the following: Lane closures and traffic control are needed. Measurements for large sites are time consuming.

        "content": "GPR (Asphalt Compaction Assessment) Target of Investigation Ground penetrating radar (GPR) can be used for surface investigation of asphalt pavements. In assessing the density of the hot mix asphalt (HMA) surface course, GPR can be used for the following applications: Measurement of uniformity of HMA density during construction. (1) Detection of segregation and mix densification. A device that uses the GPR technology for the evaluation of pavement density is referred to density profiling system (DPS) that continuously measure asphalt compaction quality. DPS improves the measurement coverage over current quality assurance methods and mitigates destructive approaches. Description The density of asphalt concrete plays a significant role in long-term pavement performance. It has been shown that each 1% increase in air content beyond 7% ,leads to a 10% loss in pavement life . (2) Traditionally, cores at random locations were taken to investigate the asphalt concrete density. However, this process is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and provides information at discrete locations. Furthermore, selecting locations of coring, and the number of cores can be subjective. DPS is capable of providing continues HMA dielectric measurements that can be converted to the mat compaction level using calibration curves based on limited core data or plant mixed material samples. (3) A DPS can be deployed on a single or multiple GPR antennas and may carry by a push cart (figure 1) or a vehicle. Source. FHWA. Figure 1. Photo. Data collection with a DPS. Figure 1. Data collection with a DPS. The photo shows a worker collecting data with a DPS. The DPS deployed on a push cart with three air- coupled antennas attached on a metal bar.

Physical Principal In general, GPR systems operate by sending discrete electromagnetic wave pulses (with a frequency range of 100\u20135,000 MHz) into a structure and then capturing the reflections from layer interfaces or other reflectors within the structure. Radar obeys the laws governing reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves and is affected by the dielectric properties of the material: conductivity and the dielectric constant. (4) At each interface, part of the incident energy will be reflected back, and part will be transmitted beyond the interface. The ratio of reflected to transmitted energy depends on the contrast in dielectric properties of the materials on either side of the interface. As shown in figure 2, the largest peak of air-coupled GPR is the reflection from the pavement surface. The amplitudes before the direct couple are internally generated noise, and they should be removed from the trace prior to signal processing. By using the signal reflected by the pavement surface, the dielectric constant of the surface can be estimated using the amplitude of signal reflected from the pavement surface and the signal reflected off a metal plate. An equation for calculating the dielectric of a HMA surface is presented in figure 3. Source: FHWA. A. GPR propagation and reflection. This illustration is a schematic showing the reflection of an air-coupled ground penetrating radar (GPR) signal from a pavement structure. The box at the top of the figure represents a GPR antenna. Below this box is a section that represents the asphalt layer, and below that is another section that represents the base layers of the pavement structure. Arrows represent the propagation and reflection of the GPR signal at the interface of multiple layers. At each layer, some of the signal is reflected back toward the antenna. E subscript a and E subscript b are the dielectric constants of the asphalt layer and base layer. T subscript a and T subscript b are the travel time of the GPR signal in the asphalt layer and base layer.\nSource: FHWA. B. Multiple GPR A-scans This illustration depicts waveforms of the ground penetrating radar signal. Each curve in the graph is an A-scan. The first obvious peak on each A-scan represents the direct couple. The second peak (the largest peak) represents the air\u2013pavement interface. The third peak represents the asphalt\u2013base interface. Figure 2. Illustrations. Principle of air-coupled GPR for measuring pavement. (5) Figure 3. Equation.

Where: A1 = amplitude of reflection from the surface. Am = amplitude of reflection from a large metal plate on the surface. Data Acquisition Manufacturers of DPS recommend following their system-specific testing procedures when collecting dielectric data of the field. These procedures are available in the user manuals supplied by manufacturers. AASHTO PP98-20 provides the equipment and software requirements for DPS testing. (6) Data Processing After collecting data from the field, the second step is to correlate the dielectric constant with the density of asphalt concrete. This step includes taking a few cores from regions of the field with low\nto high dielectric values, and then measuring the density of the cores in the laboratory. Subsequently, a calibration curve that relates dielectrics to densities of a paving project is developed. The calibration curve can be used to convert all dielectric data of the field to the density of asphalt concrete. AASHTO PP98-20 specifies calibration and verification procedures. (6) Recent developments propose procedures to create calibration curves using plant mix material samples. (3) Data Interpretation The dielectric value of an asphalt pavement that was measured using a 2.0-GHz air-coupled GPR antenna is depicted in figure 4. Quality control can be performed based on the relationship between the dielectric value and air-void ratio for in-place HMA. (3) A low dielectric value usually indicates a large air-void ratio in HMA. \u00a9 2013 TRB. 1 ft = 0.3 m. Figure 4. Graph. Dielectric value of an asphalt pavement.

For the top graph, the x-axis ranges from 0 to 300 feet. For the second graph, the x-axis ranges from 300 to 600 feet. For the third graph, the x-axis ranges from 600 to 900 feet. For the bottom graph, the x-axis ranges from 900 to 1,175 feet. Most of the dielectric values are between 6.0 and 6.5. Large areas of low dielectric values (i.e., less than 6.0) are found with x coordinates between 0 and 50; between 100 and 200; and between 1,115 and 1,175 feet, and are labeled \u201cLow.\u201d Large areas of high dielectric values (i.e., greater than 6.5), are found in the graph with x coordinates between 250 and 290; between 950 and 1,000; and between 1,075 and 1,115 feet, and are labeled \u201cHigh.\u201d Advantages Advantages of DPS GPR include the following: Well-established field data collection processes. Real-time compaction and density data for the entire paving project. Rapid test methods. Reliable and repeatable results. Limitations Limitations of GPR include the following: Moisture on the surface of asphalt may cause changes in acquired dielectric values and bias in\ncalibration curves.

An operator is pushing the cart along the yellow edgeline of the road. The cart has four wheels, and the GPR antenna is attached at the bottom of the cart. The laptop of the GPR system is installed on the cart at waist height. Air-Coupled GPR Air-coupled antennas are noncontact systems (i.e., they do not touch the surface during surveying). Air-coupled GPR systems are usually faster than ground-coupled systems; generally, they are used as a scanning tool to indicate locations where indepth testing with other systems (including groundcoupled GPR) is needed. (4) Ground-Coupled GPR Ground-coupled antennas, unlike air-coupled systems, must remain in contact with the surface while surveying. They are able to detect defects containing sizable air pockets or significant moisture under the surface. GPR signals are reflected at layer interfaces (including objects and defects) where different dielectric constants exist within the structure. The collected data are processed and analyzed to create a condition map of defects of asphalt pavements. Physical Principle GPR operates by sending discrete electromagnetic wave pulses (with a frequency range of 100\u20135,000 MHz) into asphalt pavement and then capturing the reflections from layer interfaces or other reflectors within the structure.

Principle of air-coupled GPR for detecting pavement defects. (4) This illustration depicts waveforms of the ground penetrating radar signal. Each curve in the graph is an A-scan. The first obvious peak on each A-scan represents the direct couple. The second peak (the largest peak) represents the air\u2013pavement interface. The third peak represents the asphalt\u2013base interface. Ground-Coupled GPR The physical principles of ground-coupled GPR systems are similar to those for air-coupled GPR systems. Although slow compared to air-coupled systems, ground-coupled systems provide better depth penetration and a higher amount of readings. Thus, ground-coupled systems are better suited for in depth data collection and defining subsurface interfaces or defects. A GPR signal attenuates as it travels in a structure. Signal attenuation depends on geometric attenuation, signal scattering, reflections, and thermal losses. Two-way travel time and reflection amplitudes are recorded with a receiver antenna. When measurements are made over sequential survey points, they can be viewed as a GPR B-scan or profile (figure 4). Heterogeneities, such as voids and water, have different dielectric values from the pavement material; GPR can show irregular reflections caused by these heterogeneities.\nSource: FHWA. 1 ft = 0.3 m. Figure 4. Graph. Example GPR B-scan. This graph has an x-axis representing distance in feet ranging from 64.8 to about 83, and a y-axis representing two-way travel time in nanoseconds ranging from 0 to 10. Valid data start at the two-way travel time of about 1.2 nanoseconds, representing a signal reflected from the surface of the pavement. Many bright hyperbolas with two-way travel times of about 2.5 nanoseconds indicate the reinforcement in the pavement. Data Acquisition Manufacturers of GPR (air and ground coupled) recommend following their system-specific testing procedures when collecting data. These procedures are available in the user manuals supplied by manufacturers. Data Processing Data processing should be performed by personnel with extensive training and experience. Data processing can be done using analysis software. Preprocessing, which does not change the signal content of the original data, includes data channel splitting, data scaling, data reversing, and zero-level correction. Processing operations consist mainly of filtering operations and amplitude and dielectric value calculations. The primary objective of processing is to make GPR data more informative and easy to interpret. Figure 5 shows raw, preprocessed, and processed data.

Photo. Data collection with a ground-coupled GPR system. (2) This photo shows data collection with a ground-coupled ground penetrating radar (GPR) system from an asphalt pavement. The GPR is installed on a cart. An operator is pushing the cart along the yellow edgeline of the road. The cart has four wheels, and the GPR antenna is attached at the bottom of the cart. The laptop of the GPR system is installed on the cart at waist height. Air-Coupled GPR Air-coupled antennas are noncontact systems (i.e., they do not touch the surface during surveying). Air-coupled GPR systems are usually faster than ground-coupled systems; generally, they are used as a scanning tool to indicate locations where indepth testing with other systems (including groundcoupled GPR) is needed. (4) Ground-Coupled GPR Ground-coupled antennas, unlike air-coupled systems, must remain in contact with the surface while surveying. GPR signals are reflected at layer interfaces (including objects and defects) where different dielectric constants exist within the asphalt pavements. The collected data are processed and analyzed to measure the thickness of the asphalt pavement. Physical Principal GPR operates by sending discrete electromagnetic wave pulses (with a frequency range of 100\u20135,000 MHz) into a pavement and then capturing the reflections from layer interfaces or other reflectors within the pavement. Radar obeys the laws governing reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves and is affected by the dielectric properties of the material: conductivity and the dielectric constant. (1) At each interface, part of the incident energy will be reflected back, and part will be transmitted beyond the interface. The ratio of reflected to transmitted energy depends on the contrast in dielectric properties of the materials on either side of the interface. Air-Coupled GPR As shown in figure 3, the largest peak of air-coupled GPR is the reflection from the pavement surface. The amplitudes before the direct couple are internally generated noise, and they should be removed from the trace prior to signal processing. Reflections that occur after the surface echo represent significant interfaces within the pavement, and the measured travel time is related to the depth of the layer. These reflections could be used to estimate the thickness of different layers of the pavement. Figure 4 is an equation to calculate layer thickness. Source: FHWA.\nA. GPR propagation and reflection.

        "content": "GPR (Base, Subbase, Subgrade Thickness) Target of Investigation Ground penetrating radar (GPR) can be used for a range of subsurface investigation in pavement applications. For condition assessment of the base and subbase course of pavement, GPR can be used for measurement of the thickness levels of different layers. Description GPR testing is a widely used nondestructive evaluation technique for detecting subsurface structural elements and anomalies in structures. Two types of GPR systems are available: air coupled (figure 1) and ground coupled (figure 2). \u00a9 2013 TRB. Figure 1. Photo. Air-coupled GPR system mounted on a vehicle. (3) This photo shows data collection using an air-coupled ground penetrating radar (GPR) system. A 2-gigahertz air-coupled antenna is mounted on the rear of a van driving on an asphalt pavement. The antenna is a box approximately 2 feet tall by 2 feet long by 1 foot wide (0.6 by 0.6 by 0.3 meters). The antenna is resting on a support at bumper level and held by straps attached to a roof rack. The blue cable of the GPR runs from the antenna to the interior of the van.\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_1.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_3.jpeg]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_5.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_6.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_7.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_9.jpeg]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_11.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_13.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_15.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_17.png]\n\u00a9 2013 TRB. Figure 2. Photo. Data collection with a ground-coupled GPR system. (2) This photo shows data collection with a ground-coupled ground penetrating radar (GPR) system from an asphalt pavement. The GPR is installed on a cart. An operator is pushing the cart along the yellow edgeline of the road. The cart has four wheels, and the GPR antenna is attached at the bottom of the cart. The laptop of the GPR system is installed on the cart at waist height. Air-Coupled GPR Air-coupled antennas are noncontact systems (i.e., they do not touch the surface during surveying). Air-coupled GPR systems are usually faster than ground-coupled systems; generally, they are used as a scanning tool to indicate locations where indepth testing with other systems (including groundcoupled GPR) is needed. (4) Ground-Coupled GPR Ground-coupled antennas, unlike air-coupled systems, must remain in contact with the surface while surveying. They are able to detect defects containing sizable air pockets or significant moisture under the surface. GPR signals are reflected at layer interfaces (including objects and defects) where different dielectric constants exist within the pavement. The collected data are processed and analyzed to create a condition map of the structure or an image of the subsurface structure, including thickness and defects. Physical Principal GPR operates by sending discrete electromagnetic wave pulses (with a frequency range of 100\u20135,000 MHz) into a structure and then capturing the reflections from layer interfaces or other reflectors within the structure. Radar obeys the laws governing reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves and is affected by the dielectric properties of the material: conductivity and the dielectric constant. (1) At each interface, part of the incident energy will be reflected back, and part will be transmitted beyond the interface. The ratio of reflected to transmitted energy depends on the contrast in dielectric properties of the materials on either side of the interface. Air-Coupled GPR As shown in figure 3, the largest peak of air-coupled GPR is the reflection from the pavement surface. The amplitudes before the direct couple are internally generated noise, and they should be removed from the trace prior to signal processing. Reflections that occur after the surface echo represent significant interfaces within the pavement, and the measured travel time is related to the depth of the layer. These reflections could be used to estimate the thickness of different layers of the pavement. Figure 4 is an equation to calculate layer thickness.\nSource: FHWA. A. GPR propagation and reflection. This illustration is a schematic showing the reflection of an air-coupled ground penetrating radar (GPR) signal from a pavement structure. The box at the top of the figure represents a GPR antenna. Below this box is a section that represents the asphalt layer, and below that is another section that represents the base layers of the pavement structure. Arrows represent the propagation and reflection of the GPR signal at the interface of multiple layers. At each layer, some of the signal is reflected back toward the antenna. E subscript a and E subscript b are the dielectric constants of the asphalt layer and base layer. T subscript a and T subscript b are the travel time of the GPR signal in the asphalt layer and base layer. Source: FHWA. B. Multiple GPR A-scans. Figure 3. Illustrations. Principle of air-coupled GPR for measuring pavement thickness. (5) This illustration depicts waveforms of the ground penetrating radar signal. Each curve in the graph is an A-scan. The first obvious peak on each A-scan represents the direct couple. The second peak (the largest peak) represents the air\u2013pavement interface. The third peak represents the asphalt\u2013base interface. h subscript 1 equals the quotient of open parenthesis c times Delta t subscript 1 close parenthesis divided by the square root of epsilon subscript a.\"/>\nFigure 4. Equation. Calculation of layer thickness. Where: h1 = thickness of a layer. c = speed of the radar wave in air. \u0394t1 = time delay between two adjacent peaks. \u03b5a = dielectric of the pavement surface. Ground-Coupled GPR The physical principles of ground-coupled GPR systems are similar to those for air-coupled GPR systems. Although slow compared to air-coupled systems, ground-coupled systems provide better depth penetration and a higher amount of readings. Thus, ground-coupled systems are better suited for indepth data collection and defining subsurface interfaces or defects. A GPR signal attenuates as it travels in a structure. Signal attenuation depends on geometric attenuation, signal scattering, reflections, and thermal losses. Two-way travel time and reflection amplitudes are recorded with a receiver antenna. When measurements are made over sequential survey points, they can be viewed as a GPR B-scan or profile (figure 5). The thickness of a layer within the structure can be calculated with the equation in figure 4. Rebars and dowels are seen as bright hyperbolas. Source: FHWA. 1 ft = 0.3 m. Figure 5. Graph. Example GPR B-scan. This graph has an x-axis representing distance in feet ranging from 64.8 to about 83, and a y-axis representing two-way travel time in nanoseconds ranging from 0 to 10. Valid data start at the two-way travel time of about 1.2 nanoseconds, representing a signal reflected from the surface of the pavement. Many bright hyperbolas with two-way travel times of about 2.5 nanoseconds indicate the reinforcement in the pavement. Data Acquisition Manufacturers of GPR (air and ground coupled) recommend following their system-specific testing procedures when collecting data. These procedures are available in the user manuals supplied by\nmanufacturers. Data Processing Data processing should be performed by personnel with extensive training and experience. Data processing can be done using analysis software. Preprocessing, which does not change the signal content of the original data, includes data channel splitting, data scaling, data reversing, and zero-level correction. Processing operations consist mainly of filtering operations and amplitude and dielectric value calculations. The primary objective of processing is to make GPR data more informative and easy to interpret. Figure 6 shows raw, preprocessed, and processed data. Software can be used to \u201cpick\u201d individual objects for analysis and to calculate the depth of suspected defects or layers using the two-way travel time. \u00a9 2014 TRB. A. Raw GPR data.

The horizontal, dashed line at a depth of 0.18 meters is labeled \u201cTop of pavement,\u201d and the solid line at a depth of 0.4 meters is labeled \u201cBottom of subbase.\u201d On the lower right of the figure is the transverse profile. The x-axis represents width ranging from negative 1.5 to positive 1.5 meters. The y-axis represents depth ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 meters. Advantages Advantages of GPR include the following: Well-established field data collection processes. Rapid test methods. Reliable and repeatable results. Limitations Limitations of GPR include the following: Extensive training and experience are required for operation, data processing, and data interpretation. Steel reinforcement mesh in the surface course may prevent signal penetration. Salts in concrete (from deicing operations or seawater) may cause signal penetration problems. External electromagnetic radiation (from cell phone, radio, and television antennas) can cause signal degradation.

Air-coupled GPR systems are usually faster than ground-coupled systems; generally, they are used as a scanning tool to indicate locations where indepth testing with other systems (including groundcoupled GPR) is needed. (4) Ground-Coupled GPR Ground-coupled antennas, unlike air-coupled systems, must remain in contact with the surface while surveying. For concrete pavement with steel reinforcement or dowels, GPR can be used to detect reinforcing steel (rebars) and dowel locations and measure concrete cover depth. GPR signals are reflected at layer interfaces (including objects and defects) where different dielectric constants exist within the structure. The collected data are processed and analyzed to create a condition map of the structure or an image of the subsurface structure, including rebars and defects. Physical Principal GPR operates by sending discrete electromagnetic wave pulses (with a frequency range of 100\u20135,000 MHz) into a structure and then capturing the reflections from layer interfaces or other reflectors within the structure. Radar obeys the laws governing reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves and is affected by the dielectric properties of the material: conductivity and the dielectric constant. (1) At each interface, part of the incident energy will be reflected back, and part will be transmitted beyond the interface. The ratio of reflected to transmitted energy depends on the contrast in dielectric properties of the materials on either side of the interface. Air-Coupled GPR As shown in figure 3, the largest peak of air-coupled GPR is the reflection from the pavement surface. The amplitudes before the direct couple are internally generated\nnoise, and they should be removed from the trace prior to signal processing. Reflections that occur after the surface echo represent significant interfaces within the pavement, and the measured travel time is related to the depth of the layer or dowels. These reflections could be used to estimate the thickness of different layers of the pavement and dowels. Figure 4 is an equation to calculate layer thickness. Source: FHWA. A. GPR propagation and reflection. This illustration is a schematic showing the reflection of an air-coupled ground penetrating radar (GPR) signal from a pavement structure. The box at the top of the figure represents a GPR antenna. Below this box is a section that represents the asphalt layer, and below that is another section that represents the base layers of the pavement structure. Arrows represent the propagation and reflection of the GPR signal at the interface of multiple layers. At each layer, some of the signal is reflected back toward the antenna. E subscript a and E subscript b are the dielectric constants of the asphalt layer and base layer. T subscript a and T subscript b are the travel time of the GPR signal in the asphalt layer and base layer. Source: FHWA. B. Multiple GPR A-scans. Figure 3. Illustrations. Principle of air-coupled GPR for measuring pavement thickness. (5) This illustration depicts waveforms of the ground penetrating radar signal. Each curve in the graph is an A-scan. The first obvious peak on each A-scan represents the direct couple. The second peak (the largest peak) represents the air\u2013pavement interface. The third peak represents the asphalt\u2013base interface.\nFigure 4. Equation. Calculation of layer thickness. h subscript 1 equals the quotient of open parenthesis c times Delta t subscript 1 close parenthesis divided by the square root of epsilon subscript a. Where: h1 = thickness of a layer. c = speed of the radar wave in air. \u0394t1 = time delay between two adjacent peaks. \u03b5a = dielectric of the pavement surface. Ground-Coupled GPR The physical principles of ground-coupled GPR systems are similar to those for air-coupled GPR systems. Although slow compared to air-coupled systems, ground-coupled systems provide better depth penetration and a higher amount of readings. Thus, ground-coupled systems are better suited for indepth data collection and defining subsurface interfaces or defects. A GPR signal attenuates as it travels in a structure. Signal attenuation depends on geometric attenuation, signal scattering, reflections, and thermal losses. Two-way travel time and reflection amplitudes are recorded with a receiver antenna. When measurements are made over sequential survey points, they can be viewed as a GPR B-scan or profile (figure 5). The thickness of a layer within the structure can be calculated with the equation in figure 4. Rebars and dowels are seen as bright hyperbolas. Source: FHWA. 1 ft = 0.3 m. Figure 5. Graph. Example GPR B-scan. This graph has an x-axis representing distance in feet ranging from 64.8 to about 83, and a y-axis representing two-way travel time in nanoseconds ranging from 0 to 10. Valid data start at the two-way travel time of about 1.2 nanoseconds, representing a signal reflected from\nthe surface of the pavement. Many bright hyperbolas with two-way travel times of about 2.5 nanoseconds indicate the reinforcement in the pavement. Data Acquisition Manufacturers of GPR (air and ground coupled) recommend following their system-specific testing procedures when collecting data. These procedures are available in the user manuals supplied by manufacturers. Data Processing Data processing should be performed by personnel with extensive training and experience. Data processing can be done using analysis software. Preprocessing, which does not change the signal content of the original data, includes data channel splitting, data scaling, data reversing, and zero-level correction. Processing operations consist mainly of filtering operations and amplitude and dielectric value calculations. The primary objective of processing is to make GPR data more informative and easy to interpret. Figure 6 shows raw, preprocessed, and processed data. Software can be used to \u201cpick\u201d individual objects for analysis and to calculate the depth of suspected defects or layers using the two-way travel time. \u00a9 2014 TRB. A. Raw GPR data. This screenshot is of a B-scan of raw data. There are a few straight horizontal lines. The x-axis represents distance, and the y-axis represents depth. The GPR raw output shows noise and offset depth. \u00a9 2014 TRB. B. Preprocessed GPR data. This screenshot is of a B-scan of preprocessed data. The straight lines have been removed by deleting data with two-way travel times less than certain values. The x-axis represents distance, and the y-axis represents depth. \u00a9 2014 TRB. C.

Layer thicknesses can be visible in GPR B-scan. Figure 7 is an example of a concrete pavement B- scan showing concrete pavement slab thickness and dowel locations. The peak of the hyperbola is approximately where the dowels are located. Source: FHWA 1 m = 3.3 ft. Figure 7. Graph. A GPR scan showing layer thicknesses and dowel locations in a concrete pavement. This graph shows a concrete pavement B- scan disclosing concrete pavement slab thickness and dowel locations. The peak of the hyperbola is approximately where the dowels are located. The x-axis is the distance ranging from 0 to 120 inches. The y-axis is the depth ranging from 0 to 12 inches. Advantages Advantages of GPR include the following: Well-established field data collection processes. Rapid test methods. Reliable and repeatable results. Limitations Limitations of GPR include the following: Air-coupled GPR systems should not be relied on to determine depths of defects. Extensive training and experience are required for operation, data processing, and data interpretation. Steel reinforcement mesh in the surface course may prevent signal penetration. Salts in concrete (from deicing operations or seawater) may cause signal penetration problems. External electromagnetic radiation (from cell phone, radio, and television antennas) can cause signal degradation.

        "content": "Half-Cell Potential (HCP) Target of Investigation Half-cell potential (HCP) testing detects the presence of actively corroding reinforcing steel in concrete pavements. (1) HCP measurements can be used for in-service evaluation of reinforced concrete at any time during pavement life when an electrical connection to the reinforcing steel can be made. (2) Description HCP measurements are based on the coexistence of corroding areas (anodic half-cells) and noncorroding areas (cathodic half-cells). Measurements are taken of potential differences (voltages) across steel\u2013concrete interfaces. The HCP measuring system is electrically connected to steel reinforcement in the concrete. A portable half-cell electrode usually a copper\u2013copper sulphate (Cu/CuSO4) standard reference, is placed on the surface of the concrete. (3) The difference in potential between the reinforcement and the half-cell probe is measured; these measurements are taken in a grid pattern on the pavement to generate a spatial distribution of the corrosion potential. The difference in potential changes with the changing corrosion state of the reinforcing steel; thus, changes can be indicators of the corrosion state of the reinforcement. (4) Using empirical comparisons, the measurements can be linked to the probability of active corrosion. (3) HCP test equipment includes a high-impedance voltmeter or data recorder and Cu/CuSO4 (or similar) reference electrode. The positive terminal of the voltmeter is connected to the reinforcing steel of the structure, and the negative terminal is connected to the reference cell. (4) Different probes are available, including Cu/CuSO4 rods (figure 1) and rolling electrodes (figure 2), depending on the application. Rolling probes are better suited for rapid scanning of large, horizontal areas.

This photo shows half-cell potential (HCP) testing system with a rod electrode probe. The electrode probe is pushed against the top surface of a reinforced concrete deck. Rebars are visible from the sides of the concrete deck. The HCP gauge contains a keyboard and light-emitting diode screen resting on the concrete surface and functions as a voltmeter. The probe is connected to the HCP gauge by a wire. A clamp connects a rebar to the HCP gauge. Source: FHWA. Figure 2. Photo. HCP rolling electrode probe. This photo shows a half-cell potential rolling electrode probe. The rolling electrode probe has covers on the sides and sponges between the sides and the roller. Physical Principle The corrosion of steel in concrete is similar to the electrochemical mechanism of the corrosion of a metal in an electrolyte. This likeness implies that separate anodic and cathodic processes take place simultaneously on the same metal surface. At the anodic site, iron is dissolved and then oxidized into iron ions, leaving electrons in the steel. At the cathodic site, the oxygen is reduced, and hydroxyl ions are produced. (5) This electrochemical process generates an electrical field. (5) The potential of this field is measured using a high-impedance voltmeter and reference electrode, where the positive terminal of the voltmeter is connected to the reinforcing steel of the structure and the negative terminal is connected to the reference electrode (figure 3). The reference electrode is usually galvanically connected to the concrete surface using a wet sponge. (6) The input impedance of the voltmeter should be in the range of 10 6 to 10 9 \u03a9. (6)\n\u00a9 2015 N. Gucunski, Rutgers University.Note: Isopotential lines are measured in millivolts. Figure 3. Illustration. Principle of HCP measurement. (3) This illustration is a schematic of the principle of half-cell potential measurement. A circle labeled \u201cHalf-cell probe (reference electrode)\u201d rests on a thick concrete surface. The view of the surface is a cutaway from the side. The half-cell probe is connected to a square labeled \u201cVoltmeter\u201d showing negative 414 millivolts. The voltmeter is also connected to a rebar embedded horizontally in the concrete. A corroded portion of the metal rod is labeled \u201cAnode.\u201d Uncorroded portions of the rod are labeled \u201cCathode.\u201d The voltmeter is connected to a cathode portion of the rod. Current flows from the anode to a cathode. Isopotential lines rise near the ends of the anode portion of the rod. Three of the isopotential lines start at one end of the anode and return at the other end. These three lines are labeled negative 500, negative 600, and negative 700 millivolts. Data Acquisition The following is a summary of the HCP data collection procedure described in ASTM C876-09, Standard Test Method for Corrosion Potentials of Uncoated Reinforcing Steel in Concrete: (2) Lay out a grid on the pavement. 1. Electrically connect the reinforcing steel to the positive lead of the voltmeter by doing the 2. following: Locate the steel using a rebar locator, drill down to the reinforcement, and connect a lead wire to the steel using a self-tapping screw drilled into the rebar. Ensure that all measurement locations are electrically continuous with this screw. If required, use multiple screws and corresponding measurement areas to cover the entire survey area. Electrically connect the reference electrode to the negative lead of the voltmeter. 3. Wet the contact sponge of the reference electrode to ensure good electrical contact with the 4. concrete pavement by doing the following (prewetting can also be done, if conditions allow): Wet the entire deck surface or testing locations, but make sure no free surface water remains between test locations before taking measurements. Place a prewetted sponge on each test location before taking measurements, and leave the sponge in place for the duration of collection at that location. Place the reference electrode on the test point and record the potential measurement (by hand 5. or with the data acquisition instrument) after the voltage measurement has stabilized. Move to the next test location and repeat the data collection procedure; using a rolling 6. electrode probe allows the probe to remain in contact with the surface while moving from one test location to the next.\nAfter testing is complete, patch all tapped locations. 7. Data Processing Typically, no operator processing of HCP data is performed, and the results are visualized as the measurements are taken. (6) Data-processing software is usually included with the equipment. The data are plotted in a straightforward way, such as in a contour map, using the spatial coordinates of the measurements to show areas of the reinforcing steel with high probabilities of active corrosion, low probabilities of active corrosion, and transition zones that span the measurements in between these potentials (figure 4). (6) \u00a9 2015 Rutgers CAIT.1 ft = 0.3 m. Figure 4. Contour map. HCP measurements. (3) This contour map shows half-cell potential measurements of a testing area. The x-axis represents longitudinal distance, ranging from 0 to approximately 85 feet. The y-axis represents lateral distance, ranging from 0 to 12 feet. Below the graph is a scale indicating probability of corrosion. Values of negative 720 to negative 350 millivolts indicate a 90-percent probability of corrosion. Values of negative 350 to negative 200 millivolts represent an uncertain or transition area. Values between negative 200 and approximately negative 20 millivolts represent a 90- percent probability of no corrosion. The majority of the map indicates a 90-percent probability of corrosion and is labeled \u201cHigh.\u201d A few pronounced areas indicate a 90-percent probability of no corrosion and are labeled \u201cLow.\u201d Typically, areas with potentials greater than \u2212200 mV have a 90-percent probability of no active corrosion, and areas with potentials less than \u2212350 mV have a 90-percent probability of active corrosion. Areas with potentials between these values, however, have an uncertain probability of active corrosion. (2) For each structure, the potential thresholds need to be adjusted based on the structure\u2019s construction and maintenance history as well as conditions that exist during measurement. (6) Data Interpretation HCP data should be interpreted by engineers or specialists in corrosion activity and concrete materials. In addition to HCP data, other methods (e.g., electrical resistivity, depth of carbonation, chloride contents, delamination surveys, rate of corrosion, environmental conditions) should be used to determine the corrosion activity of steel reinforcement and its probable effect on the service life of the pavement. (2) Advantages\nAdvantages of using HCP measurements include the following: Indicative of the probability of active corrosion of reinforcing steel. Rapid and easy to use. Effective over large areas. Minimal training required for data collection. Straightforward data processing. Limitations Limitations of using HCP measurements include the following: Analysis requires experienced personnel and correlation with other information to formulate conclusions about corrosion activity of reinforcing steel. Corrosion of steel is not directly measured. Overlays, paint, and other coatings may prevent adequate electrical connectivity between the device and pavement. Measurements cannot be taken for epoxy-coated reinforcing steel. Electrical connectivity to reinforcing steel is required throughout the test area. Specialized procedures may be required if the concrete resistivity is too high for the normal procedures (e.g., because of dryness). (2) References Marks, V.J. (1977).

        "content": "Impact Echo (IE) Target of Investigation Primary applications of impact echo (IE) technology include the following: Detecting and characterizing defects, such as delamination and debonding in tnnel concrete lining and other members. (1) Measuring the thickness of slabs and walls. Impact-echo has been successfully used as a means of non-destructive and time-effective evaluation of grouting quality in tunnel lining. (9) Description IE testing is a seismic or stress wave\u2013based technology used to detect defects (primarily delamination) in concrete. The objective of an IE survey is to detect and characterize wave reflectors, or resonators, in a concrete structural element. IE devices can have multiple probes (figure 1) or a single probe (figure 2). Each probe consists of an impactor and receiver. Source: FHWA. Figure 1. Photo.

An inset on the right is a closeup view of the IE sensors. The locations of the impactor and receiver are indicated with arrows. Physical Principle IE testing is conducted using an impactor and sensor. The impact generates waves that propagate within the solid material. Waves are reflected by internal defects (differences in acoustic impedance) or boundaries. The reflected waves, or echoes, return to the surface and are measured by the receiver. The multiple reflected waves monitored by the sensor manifest as resonance conditions in frequency domain analyses. Defects, such as delaminations and big voids, can be detected by changes in the resonant frequency compared to intact areas. The principle of IE testing is illustrated in figure 3. The resonant frequency of areas with deep delaminations is higher than that of the sound areas (thickness mode). The resonant frequency of areas with large shallow delaminations is lower than that of the sound areas owing to excitation of the flexural mode.\n\u00a9 2015 N. Gucunski, Rutgers University.

The upper part of the figure shows a cross section side view of the IE test being performed at different locations on a concrete slab. A rectangular area represents the concrete slab. There are impact hammers and sensors at four locations on the slab surface. Arrows represent the propagation and reflection of the stress waves in the concrete after impacts. Roughly horizontal curves indicate the locations of delaminations in the concrete. The lower part of the figure contains four graphs showing corresponding spectrums obtained from the IE tests at the different locations. The x-axis of each graph represents frequency, ranging from 0 to 40,000 hertz. The y-axis of each graph represents normalized amplitude, ranging from 0 to 1.2. The first graph on the left has a high peak at approximately 10,000 hertz and is labeled \u201cGood.\u201d The second graph has a high peak at approximately 10,000 hertz and a smaller peak at approximately 20,000 hertz and is labeled \u201cFair.\u201d The third graph has a high peak at approximately 20,000 hertz and two smaller peaks, one close to the origin and one at approximately 7,000 hertz, and is labeled \u201cPoor.\u201d The fourth graph has a peak at approximately 4,000 hertz and is labeled \u201cSerious.\u201d Data Acquisition A complete data collection procedure is provided in ASTM C1383-15, Standard Test Method for Measuring the P-Wave Speed and the Thickness of Concrete Plates Using the Impact-Echo Method. (4) The structural surface to be surveyed should be cleaned of debris before IE testing. The survey should be conducted on the densest grid possible. The grid should be marked using washable paint or chalk. The impactor of the IE system should be carefully selected to provide enough energy in the frequency range of interest. Some impactors are equipped with a sensor to measure the characteristics of the impact. Many IE systems use steel balls of different sizes as impact sources; the center and maximum frequencies are inversely proportional to the diameters of the balls. Data Processing The amplitude spectrum obtained from the fast Fourier transform analysis of the time-domain signal\nwill show dominant peaks at certain frequencies, which can be interpreted to assess the slab thickness or potential delamination or debonding. The thickness mode normally dominates the spectral response of a platelike structure that does not contain any near-surface defects. (5) The frequency of the fundamental thickness mode can be related to the thickness of the member (figure 4). Figure 4. Equation. Calculation of thickness or depth. T equals the product of beta times the quotient of C subscript p divided by the product of 2 times f subscript IE. Where: T = thickness or depth of a defect. \u03b2 = Correction factor. Cp = Compressive-wave velocity of concrete. fIE = IE frequency. Accuracy or uncertainty in thickness estimates from IE testing depends on a pooled error of the return-frequency measurement and P-wave velocity determination (figure 4). The typical uncertainty in thickness measurement is 5\u201310 percent. (See references 3, 4, 6, and 7.) Other factors that may impact uncertainty include the stiffness of the underlying layer, closeness to boundaries, and texture of the concrete surface. (4) Data Interpretation IE results are presented in various forms, some describing the position of reflectors, some interpreting the condition with respect to the state of delamination. (2) Figure 5 presents the dominant reflectors, or resonators, in terms of the spectral surface. The colors indicate different dominant frequencies identified in the response spectrum. Greens indicate normal thickness and no defects. Reds correspond to flexural oscillations of shallow delaminations. Source: FHWA. 1 inch = 2.54 cm. Figure 5. Contour map.

The y-axis represents lateral distance, ranging from 4 to 36 inches. To the right of the graph is a color scale of frequency, ranging from 0 to 15 kilohertz. The majority of the map shows a dominant frequency around 10 kilohertz. Eight areas with low frequencies indicate defects in the concrete deck.\nResults of IE tests often use different condition grades to indicate the progression of delamination development (figure 6). For example, fair and poor grades refer to incipient or progressed delamination, and serious grades correspond to either shallow or wide delamination. \u00a9 2015 Rutgers CAIT. 1 ft = 0.305 m.

The x-axis represents longitudinal distance in feet, ranging from 0 to 84. The y-axis represents lateral distance numbered from 2 to 12 feet. A color scale at the bottom shows levels of delamination, ranging from sound to serious. The contour map contains irregular areas of different conditions. Most of the map shows sound and fair conditions. Large areas of serious condition are located at longitudinal distances of 0\u20134, 18\u201324, 28\u201334, 48\u201352, and 76\u201380 feet. Advantages Advantages of IE testing include the following: Early detection of delamination. Capable of detecting debonding between layers, such as concrete-type overlays. Fast data analysis with respect to delamination characterization. Unambiguous data interpretation. Insensitive to traffic-induced vibrations. Reliable and repeatable when conducted properly by an experienced operator. Limitations Limitations of IE testing include the following: Moderate to significant expertise and training required for equipment setup and data collection, processing, and interpretation. Slow data collection using traditional single-probe equipment; requires traffic control and lane closure. Dense test grid necessary to accurately define the boundaries of delaminated areas, adding to the test duration. Complex evaluation of conditions for overlaid roadways; cannot assess the condition of slabs in areas where the overlay is debonded. Consideration of geometrical and boundary effects needed, especially for structural elements, such as girders, columns, and caps.

        "content": "Impulse Response (IR) Target of Investigation Impulse response methods can be used to evaluate pavements by detecting the following: Debonding, delamination, and honeycombing within concrete pavement. Voids below concrete slabs and at joints. Distress at the interface of a portland cement concrete overlay and concrete pavement can induce debonding. Debonding will destroy the integrity of the pavement and cause a loss of structural capacity. Delamination in concrete pavements is caused by inappropriate construction and distress from rebar corrosion. (1) Without proper treatment, delamination may cause further deterioration problems, such as spalling. Honeycombing in the pavement can be caused by a poorly graded concrete mix or insufficient vibration at the time of placement. Honeycombing can provide paths for moisture and cause further deterioration owing to freeze\u2013thaw cycles or rebar corrosion. Voids below the concrete surface course usually occur near cracks and joints or along the pavement edge. Voids can be caused by many factors, such as the expulsion of water and soil through an open joint or shoulder under traffic loads, the compaction of base materials, subgrade failure, and bridge- approach failure. Voids may cause distress and serviceability loss in concrete pavements. Description The impulse response method is a nondestructive testing method used in quality control and condition assessment of pavements and deep foundations. The method was first developed in the 1970s and used in performing quality control for drilled shafts. More recent uses of the impulse response method include determining subgrade moduli and detecting the presence of voids or loss of support below rigid pavements and slabs and in reinforced concrete bridges and concrete tunnel linings. The method uses a mobility spectrum to measure the dynamic response of concrete pavement. Damaged areas are detected when the mobility spectrum takes significantly different shapes and amplitudes from those at sound locations. (2) An impulse response testing system is shown in figure 1. Source: FHWA. Figure 1. Photo. Impulse response testing system. This photo is of an impulse response testing system. There is a black hammer, a velocity transducer, and a laptop sitting on top of a data acquisition box. The hammer and transducer are connected to the data acquisition system by cables.

As shown in figure 2, an impact load is applied on the surface of the pavement with an instrumented hammer; the resulting stress wave propagates in the pavement and is reflected by the interfaces. The dynamic response is measured using a geophone at a nearby location on the surface. The signal of the applied impact force and the response from the geophone are transformed into the frequency domain to obtain the corresponding spectrum. The ratio of the measured velocity response to the impact force in the frequency domain is called the mobility spectrum. An example of a mobility spectrum is shown in figure 3. Compared to the impact echo method, the impulse response method relies more on the structural response under the impact, and the frequency range of interest is also much lower. Source: FHWA.F = force; f = frequency; t = time; V = velocity; FFT = fast Fourier transform. Figure 2. Illustration. Signal processing of impulse response test. This illustration is a schematic of signal processing. Impulse response testing is shown in the lower part of the figure. A block represents the concrete pavement, and a curve through the block represents a defect. The hammer impacts the surface of the concrete, and the response of the concrete is picked up by the geophone. In the upper part of the figure are four charts. Two charts show the impact. The upper left chart, with an x-axis representing time and a y-axis representing force, shows the force signal in the time domain. The lower left chart, with an x-axis representing frequency and a y-axis representing force, shows the force in the frequency domain after fast Fourier transforming. Two charts show the response. The upper right chart, with an x-axis representing time and a y-axis representing velocity, shows the velocity signal in the time domain. The lower right chart, with an x-axis representing frequency and a y-axis representing velocity, shows the velocity in the frequency domain after fast Fourier transforming.\n\u00a9 2018 Germann Instruments.1 (m/s)/N = 0.737(ft/s)/lbf. Figure 3. Graph. Example of a mobility spectrum. (3) This graph has an x-axis representing frequency in hertz that ranges from 0 to 800. The y-axis represents mobility, ranging from 0 to 2.5 times 10 to the power of negative 7 meters per second per newton. A curve on the chart represents the mobility spectrum. A dashed line represents the average mobility at between 100 and 800 hertz on the x-axis and at about 1.9 times 10 to the power of negative 7 on the y-axis. The reciprocal of the slope of the solid line represents the dynamic stiffness, which equals 0.48 meganewtons per millimeter. Data Acquisition ASTM C1740-10, Standard Practice for Evaluating the Condition of Concrete Plates Using the Impulse-Response Method, provides the procedure for using the impulse response method to rapidly evaluate the condition of existing concrete pavements. (4) The equipment manufacturer\u2019s instructions should also be followed to operate the equipment correctly. The general procedures for data collection on pavements are summarized as follows: Remove any debris from the survey area to prepare the surface. Grind the surface if it is too 1. rough. Remove loose material before placing the transducer on the surface. Make sure of good contact and proper impact between the hammer and pavement. Lay out a grid on the surface of the concrete slab to be tested. Grid spacing normally ranges 2. between 500 and 2,000 mm (20 and 80 inches). Closer spacing can be used for smaller slabs or to locate smaller anomalous regions. Impact the concrete surface with a hammer to generate transient stress waves in the concrete. 3. Measure the response with a geophone placed adjacent to the impact load. 4. Record the force and velocity waveforms with a data acquisition system. The system can 5. synchronize data acquisition of the impact load and velocity response. Data Processing The impact force is measured by the load cell, and the velocity is measured by the geophone. These signals are then transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain by using the fast Fourier transform. The mobility spectrum is obtained by dividing the velocity spectrum by the impact force spectrum at each test point. The mobility spectrum summarizes the response of the\nconcrete pavement as a function of frequency. Key parameters, such as the average mobility and dynamic stiffness, are computed from the mobility spectrum for each test point. Average mobility is calculated from the mobility values over the 100\u2013800 Hz frequency range. Dynamic stiffness is calculated as the inverse of the slope of the mobility spectrum up to 40 Hz. A series of regularly spaced, high peaks in the mobility spectrum usually indicate resonant frequencies. Data Interpretation Average mobility and dynamic stiffness are related to density, elastic modulus, thickness, and presence of internal defects. Average mobility and dynamic stiffness can be displayed in the form of contour plots in order to identify likely locations of anomalous regions. An example contour map of the average mobility of a bridge slab is shown in figure 4. The locations of three drilled core samples are labeled. (3) \u00a9 2018 Germann Instruments.Note: S1\u2013S10 are grid line names.1 m = 3.3 ft. Figure 4. Contour map. Average mobility and related cores. (3) This figure consists of a contour map and three photos. The contour map shows the results of impulse response testing for a concrete slab. The x-axis is the test point in meters ranging from 20 to 1, and the y-axis is the test point in meters ranging from S1 to S10. The map is divided according to the lanes of the slab, and is labeled \u201cMiddle lane,\u201d \u201cOuter lane,\u201d and \u201cShoulder.\u201d A color-coded scale of the average mobility ranges from 0 to 20. On the map, most of the area has values between 4 and 8. The lower left corner (with x values between 20 and 17 meters and y values between S1 and S6) and the upper right corner (with x values between 4 and 1 meters and y values between S4 and S10) show low values between 0 to 4. High values between 16 and 20 are found near coordinates (2, S3) and (5, S10), and another high value between 12 and 16 is found near the coordinate (16, S3). In the lower part of the figure, photos of three cylinders of concrete are linked to the map by arrows. The cylinder on the left has a wide crack. It is linked to the location (16, S3) and has an average mobility of 13. The cylinder in the middle has no crack. It is linked to the coordinate (9, S3) and has an average mobility of 7. The cylinder on the right has a crack, and its bottom part is missing. It is linked to the coordinate (2, S3) and has an average mobility of 18. When debonding or delamination is present within the concrete surface course or voids exist beneath it, average mobility will increase and dynamic stiffness will decrease greatly. The peak mobility below 100 Hz becomes appreciably higher than the average mobility between 100 and 800 Hz. Voids beneath slabs are more likely when the ratio of this peak to average mobility exceeds 2.5. (5) Figure 5 is an example of the mobility spectrum for locations where voids exist beneath the\npavement. \u00a9 2018 Germann Instruments.1 (m/s)/N = 0.737 (ft/s)/lbf. Figure 5. Graph. Comparison of mobility spectrums for concrete with good support and concrete with a void. (3) The x-axis of this graph is frequency in hertz, ranging from 0 to 600. The y-axis of this graph is mobility, ranging from 0 to 3 times 10 to the power of negative 6 meters per second per newton. Two curves in the chart represent mobility spectrums. One curve represents the mobility spectrum when a void is below the concrete slab; it shows a peak at 20 hertz. The other curve represents good support under the concrete slab; it is rising slowly. When honeycombing exists in a concrete pavement, mobility increases with frequency over the frequency range of 100\u2013800 Hz. (6,7) As shown in figure 6, the mobility slope is determined from the best linear fit to the mobility spectrum between 100 and 800 Hz. A contour plot of the mobility slope can be used to indicate regions where honeycombing is likely owing to poor consolidation. \u00a9 2018 Germann Instruments.1 (m/s)/N= 0.737(ft/s)/lbf. Figure 6. Graph. Comparison of mobility spectrums of solid concrete and honeycombed concrete. (3) The x-axis of this graph is frequency in hertz, ranging from 0 to 800. The y-axis of the graph is mobility, ranging from 0 to 10 to the power of negative 5 meters per second per newton. Solid lines represent two mobility spectrums. One line represents the mobility spectrum for a honeycombed concrete slab. Another line represents the mobility spectrum of solid concrete. Two dashed, straight lines are linear fittings of the mobility spectrum between 100 and 800 hertz. The dashed line corresponding to the honeycombed concrete has a greater slope than the dashed line corresponding to the solid concrete. Advantages Advantages of the impulse response method include the following: Simple procedures for data collection. Automatic data processing and fast output.\nGood repeatability of test results. Limitations Limitations of the impulse response method include the following: Small defects might be undetectable. Reliable data interpretation is highly dependent on the selection of test points.

        "content": "Inertial Profiler \u2013 Pavement (IP) Target of Investigation Inertial profilers are primarily used to measure the profile of the pavement surface. Road profiles are analyzed to calculate a smoothness or ride quality index, the most common of which is the International Roughness Index (IRI). Description Smoothness is related to the ride quality of a pavement structure. Roughness is defined as a surface\u2019s deviations from a true plane, with characteristic dimensions that affect a vehicle\u2019s ride quality. (1) Rough or uneven pavement adversely affects driver safety, fuel efficiency, ride quality, vehicle and tire condition, and pavement durability. (1) To quantify the smoothness of the road surface, inertial profiler data are used to develop road profiles. There are two types of inertial profilers available: high speed and lightweight. (2) High-Speed Inertial Profilers Transportation agencies use high speed inertial profilers (figure 1) for measuring pavement roughness. The measurement equipment is mounted on the front or rear of a data collection vehicle, and relevant data are collected at posted speeds. An inertial profiler may be equipped with additional components that may be used to perform sign and signal inventories, take right-of-way video, produce two- and three-dimensional images of the pavement surface, and measure features like highway grade and cross slope.

Most agencies that have inertial profiler-based smoothness specifications allow the use of lightweight profilers. Rutgers CAIT/\u00a9 2016 N. Gucunski. Figure 2. Photo. Lightweight IP. This photo is of a small cart modified to act as a lightweight inertial profiler. A metal frame that carries the sensor is attached to the front of the cart; it is slightly wider than the cart. Physical Principle Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of a high speed inertial profiler. The inertial profiler system usually includes an accelerometer to measure the movement of the vehicle frame, noncontact sensors (commonly lasers) to measure the relative displacement between the vehicle frame and the road surface, and a distance-measuring instrument (DMI) to record the distance along the roadway. The data these sensors gather are collectively analyzed to produce a simulation of the longitudinal profile of the roadway via the equation in figure 4. \u00a9 2005 The Regent of the University of Michigan. Figure 3. Illustration. Principle of a high-speed IP. (3) This two-dimensional schematic shows the side view of a van carrying the high-speed inertial profiler. A straight line at the bottom represents the road surface. A height sensor at the bottom of the van measures the distance to the road surface. A small box attached to the top of the height sensor is the accelerometer. A speed/distance sensor is attached to the front wheel. A computer inside the vehicle is connected to the sensors with cables.\nFigure 4. Equation. Calculation of profile elevation. Profile elevation equals the double integration of A minus H. Where: Profile elevation = simulated longitudinal profile. A = acceleration. H = height. Data Acquisition Figure 5 is a graphic profile recorded by a profiler. The profiler\u2019s computer acquired the acceleration data from the accelerometer, the distance between the road surface and the base from the laser sensor and the distance traveled from the DMI. An algorithm calculated and recorded the profile of the pavement at each data location. Source: FHWA.1 mm = 0.0393 inches; 1 m = 3.28 ft. Figure 5. Graph. Profile recorded by a profiler. (4) This graph depicts a recorded profile. The x axis is distance in meters ranging from 0 to 160. The y-axis is elevation in millimeters ranging from negative 15 to positive 10. A curve representing the profile has many peaks and troughs at multiple distances such as 50, 65, 75, 89, and 125 meters. Data Processing Profile data can be used to calculate the IRI and ride number (RN) for a surface. Data that an inertial profiler records usually needs filtering to remove noise before further analysis. (4) The computation of IRI is based on a mathematical model called a quarter-car model (figure 6). The response of the quarter car is simulated on the measured profile to calculate the suspension deflection. This simulation is performed for a speed of 50 mph (80.5 kph). The absolute values of the suspension\u2019s movement, obtained from the simulation, are summed and then divided by the simulation length to obtain the average suspension movement over the simulated length. The IRI has units of slope; the most common units are inches per mile or meters per kilometer.\n\u00a9 1998 The Regent of the University of Michigan. Figure 6. Illustration. Quarter-car model used to compute IRI. (5) This schematic is of the quarter-car model. The upper part of the figure is a side-view outline of a car. The car is traveling on an uneven road surface. There is a system of mass blocks, springs, and a damper at the rear wheel of the car. The lower part of the figure is a closeup view of the mass\u2013spring\u2013damper system, which includes a block representing body mass, a suspension spring and damper, a block for axle mass, and the tire spring on top of the uneven road surface. The RN was developed to estimate the results of a 0 to 5 rating given by road users regarding a section of roadway. A RN of 0 represents the maximum possible roughness and a RN of 5 represents a perfectly smooth road. The gain plot provides an indication of the impact varying wavelengths in the longitudinal profile on the resulting IRI where gain represents an amplification (i.e., multiplier) on the wavelength. The wavelengths represent an approximate length of the event within the profile such that the longest wavelengths represent the grades of the roadway and the smallest wavelengths represent microtexture of the surface. Figure 7 provides the gain plot associated with the IRI which is most impacted by wavelengths of approximately 8 ft (2.4 m) and 50 ft (15.4 m). (6) The RN, as shown in Figure 8, is most sensitive to wavelengths of approximately 20 ft (6.1 m). (6) Figure 7. Graph. Response of IRI filter. (6) RN equals 5 times e to the power of the product of negative 160 times PI.\nFigure 8. Graph. Response of RN filter. (6) PI equals the square root of PI subscript L squared plus PI subscript R squared all over 2. Data Interpretation The IRI and RN are usually presented in a tabular format. Acceptable IRI values depend on the class of road. For new asphalt highway pavements, they range from 52 to 66 inches/mile (0.810 to 1.030 m/km). For new concrete highway pavements, the range is from 57 to 72 inches/miles (0.890 to 1.130 m/km). (7) Advantages The following are advantages of using inertial profilers: Repeatability and accuracy are high. High speed inertial profilers can perform data collection at highway speeds. Data collection with high speed inertial profilers does not require lane closure. Lightweight inertial profilers can be used for testing before concrete has gained sufficient strength for regular traffic operations. Lightweight inertial profilers require a short lead-in distance to achieve testing speed and can be used in constrained construction zones. Limitations The following is a limitation of using inertial profilers: Inability to collect accurate data at low speeds (less than 15 to 20 mph) and stop-and-go conditions. (8) Data may be impacted by weather conditions such as falling precipitation or high wind with potential blown objects.

        "content": "Infrared Thermography (IT) Target of Investigation IR thermography is an NDE method used for the following applications: Detection of delamination, overlay debonding, and voids in concrete decks and tunnels. Detection of delamination in concrete pavements and quality control during asphalt paving. Detection of voids in shallow tendon ducts (thin concrete cover). Detection of near surface cracks and segregation/honeycombing in concrete elements. (1) Description IR thermography is an NDE technology used in many engineering applications to detect defects and deterioration, thermal and gas leaks, and so on. It has been used to detect defects in transportation infrastructures since the 1980s. This primarily included detection of delamination, voids, and similar defects and anomalies. The detection of defects by IR thermography is based on measuring temperature variations on the surface of an element as a result of differences in thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of materials and thermal conduction discontinuities within the element. Maps of surface temperature (thermograms) are generated from images taken by infrared cameras (figure 1) that measure the infrared radiation emitted by a body and converted into an electrical signal. The wavelengths of interest are between 0.7 and14 \u00b5m. In most cases, a qualitative data analysis is done even though a number of programs were developed to automatically detect and interpret different types of defects or anomalies. Figure 1. Photo.

Thermal radiation (emissivity) of materials is controlled by three main properties that influence the heat flow and distribution within a material: thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and mass density. Infrared cameras measure the thermal radiation emitted by a body to capture the regions with temperature differences. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the physical principle of IR thermography in detecting defects in concrete decks. When solar or other natural radiation, as in the case of passive thermography, heats up the deck, the deck and all the objects in the deck emit some energy back, sometimes following different thermal paths (figure 2). Delamination, voids, and other anomalies, which in some cases may be filled with water, have different thermal conductivity and thermal capacity than the surrounding concrete. Therefore, the area on top of a delaminated area may heat up faster after the sunrise and cool down more quickly during and after the sunset compared to sound concrete. As a result, those areas may develop surface temperatures up to several degrees centigrade higher than the surrounding sound concrete areas when ambient conditions are favorable. (2) In the case of active thermography, the surface of the object is heated by a heater to create thermal contrasts between the defects of interest and the element (figure 3). Figure 2. Illustration. Heat Cycle of a Deck After Sunset (left) and After Sunrise (right). (2) Heat Cycle of a Deck After Sunset (left) and After Sunrise (right). The figure has two, two-dimensional schematics, one on the right and one on the left. Each schematic is a side, cut-away view of a concrete deck. Two horizontal rebars are embedded in each deck, one above the other. The deck in each image has an anomaly and a crack between the two rebars. The image on the left is of nighttime, with a dark blue sky and a crescent moon. The image on the right is of daytime, with a light blue sky and a small cloud. In the nighttime image on the left, the top surface of the deck is the colder surface and the bottom surface is the warmer surface. Arrows rise vertically through the deck, turning from red at the bottom to blue at the top. In the daytime image on the right, the top surface of the deck is the warmer surface and the bottom surface is the colder surface. Arrows descend vertically through the deck, turning from red at the top to blue at the bottom. In both images, the arrows beyond the anomaly and crack, in the direction of heat flux, are less pronounced than the other arrows, indicating less heat flux.\nFigure 3. Illustration. Active Infrared Thermography, with the Surface Heated by a Heater and the Thermal Radiation Captured by an Infrared Camera. Active Infrared Thermography, with the Surface Heated by a Heater and the Thermal Radiation Captured by an Infrared Camera. The figure is a two-dimensional schematic of a concrete deck. The schematic is a side, cut-away view of the deck. Two horizontal rebars are embedded in the deck, one above the other. An anomaly and a crack are between the two rebars. An infrared camera is above the deck, pointed downwards. Parabolic red lines indicate a heat flux flowing to the deck. Surface radiation is propagating from the deck to the camera. From 4.IRT-Data- Acquisitionv2.docx: Data Acquisition Depending on the heating source, infrared thermography surveys are described as passive or active. Passive IR thermography is more commonly used since it is uses natural heating sources. In most cases, the sun is the heating source and, thus, structures directly exposed to sun heating (for example, bridge decks) are good candidates for passive IR thermography. The best time for an IR survey is between 5 and 9 hours after sunrise or at about the same number of hours after sunset. Experiments have shown the highest temperature contrasts are achieved during those periods. Other environmental factors can affect the effectiveness of an IR thermography survey, like cloudiness or precipitation. (3) The survey is conducted using IR cameras (figure 4). Modern cameras simultaneously take IR and high resolution video images. The color coded IR images, called thermograms, represent temperature gradients. Those are evaluated for cold or hot spots, which in many cases represent and are interpreted as defects or anomalies. On the other hand, active or impulse-thermography utilizes radiant and fan heaters, or flash or halogen lamps, thus eliminating dependence on the heat from sun or other natural heating source. While active thermography may produce better controlled and higher quality results, it is used only in evaluations of smaller elements.\nFor complete data collection procedures, refer to ASTM D 4788-03 (2013), Standard Test Method for Detecting Delaminations in Bridge Decks Using Infrared Thermography. (4) Figure 4. Equation. Rate of Corrosion. Typical Infrared Thermography Camera. An infrared camera is mounted on a stand, which is attached to the camera\u2019s left side. The camera has a large rectangular screen. The camera is pointed toward a prefabricated concrete slab embedded in the ground. A truck bed and a building are in the background. From 6.IRT-Data-Interpretationv2.docx: Data Processing An IR camera records a series of geo-referenced, still, infrared images or an IR video. Images are automatically sequenced together to form a plan view of the surveyed surface or an element. In this manner, and in combination with video images, spatial information is maintained for all images, and potential defects and anomalies can be located on the element surface. Figure 5. Photo. Infrared Thermography Test Results 4 hours After Sunrise. (2) Infrared Thermography Test Results 4 hours After Sunrise. The figure has three images, side-by-side. The legend at the top of the figure says it is the third passage, four hours after sunrise, temperature equals 59 degrees Fahrenheit, relative humidity equals 45 percent. The image on the left is a photo of the surface of a deck. In the middle image, labeled Fusion image (C), a rectangular color-coded area has been\nsuperimposed on the center of the photo of the deck. Irregular areas of red and yellow indicate areas of higher temperatures, which indicate the presence of inhomogeneities. In the image on the right, labeled Infrared image (F), the color-coding has been expanded to cover the entire photo of the deck. Figure 6. Contour Map. Infrared Image of a Bridge Deck with Likely Delamination. Infrared Image of a Bridge Deck with Likely Delamination. The figure is a rectangular infrared image of a bridge deck. The two principal colors are yellow and red, with the latter indicating likely delamination. The most pronounced areas of red are in the center portion of the rectangle. Data Interpretation The infrared image or thermogram can be superimposed on the video image of the deck to enhance interpretation. As illustrated in figure 5, superimposing the thermograph on the video image can help interpret the deck condition by correlating the visible damage, such as spalling on the surface, to thermal anomalies. For example, high temperature areas in figure 5 indicate presence of inhomogeneities; for a bridge deck, this likely means delamination. Delaminated areas manifest themselves as hot spots during the warming hours of the day (figure 6) and as cold spots during the evening and night cooling hours. Advantages Fast technique when a vehicle-mounted IR camera system is used. Moderately fast technique when the survey is done manually. Requires little to no traffic control when using vehicle mounted system. More cost effective than other NDE systems in detecting similar type defects. Fast and easy equipment setup. Moderate to high accuracy when data collected is at the right time. Limitations Often difficult to select the optimal conditions needed to detect a defect. Changes in surface conditions (water, oil stains, or debris) can cause problems with data. Does not provide information about the depth of the flaw. Difficult to detect flaws deeper than 4 to 5 inches in concrete elements.

        "content": "Iowa Vacuum Joint Seal Tester (IA-VAC) Target of Investigation The Iowa vacuum joint seal tester (IA-VAC) is employed to test joint seals in concrete pavement for failure. Description Infiltration of surface water can contribute to the pumping of fines and subgrade or subbase softening or erosion. These issues can result in loss of structural support, pavement settlement, and faulting. (1\u20133) Joint sealants are used to minimize infiltration of surface water and incompressible materials into a joint system. (4,5) Joint sealants can also decrease the potential for dowel corrosion by reducing the penetration of deicing chemicals. (6) Testing the effectiveness of sealants with the IA- VAC can help diagnose sealant failures so measures can be taken to stop development of joint problems. Physical Principle The IA-VAC has a chamber that is 121.9 cm (48 inches) long by 15.2 cm (6 inches) wide. It is filled with soap and water and uses a vacuum pump to apply a vacuum pressure of less than 69 kPa (10 psi) to a joint seal that has been sprayed with a soap\u2013water solution (figure 1). Any unsealed area along the joint will produce soap bubbles after the vacuum pressure is applied (figure 2). (7) The leakage location is recorded after testing (figure 3). \u00a9 1999 North Dakota Department of Transportation. Figure 1. Photo. Soap\u2013water solution sprayed at a joint seal before testing. (7) This photo shows a vacuum tester placed on the joint between two concrete slabs. The surfaces of the concrete slabs have been sprayed with soapy water. A flexible tube extends from one end of the vacuum tester.\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_1.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_3.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_5.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_6.png]\n\u00a9 1999 North Dakota Department of Transportation.

The concrete surface is wet. \u00a9 1999 North Dakota Department of Transportation. Figure 3. Photo. A leakage location after testing. (7) This photo is of a joint after the vacuum tester has been removed. The concrete surface close to the joint is wet, and soap bubbles are visible at a few locations along the joint. Data Acquisition The following test procedure has been proposed by Purvis: (8) Select the test location 1. Wet the area of road to be covered by the test chamber with soap and water (double\u2011spray the 2. sealed joint with soap and water). Place a short piece of impermeable foam under each end of the test chamber (if the joint seal 3. is more than 3 mm (0.125 inches) lower than the road surface in the joint).\nPlace the test chamber over the joint; compress the chamber onto the road surface by having 4. the operator stand on it until a vacuum indication is seen. Record the test location, vacuum reading, and the number and causes of leaks. 5. Close the vacuum line valve and then release the vacuum valve. 6. Repeat this process at each test location. 7. Data Processing No data processing is needed. Data Interpretation Data are usually presented in a tabular form. By analyzing the results from the IA-VAC tests, information on the number and types of leaks can be obtained. (9) Advantages Advantages of the IA-VAC include the following: Testing equipment is easy to use. Single testing (without double checking) is fast. Cost is low. Limitations Limitations of the IA-VAC include the following: Lane closure and traffic control may be needed. Types of joint sealant failure (adhesive or cohesive) cannot be differentiated. Further analysis of causes of sealant failures requires professional experts. References Federal Highway Administration. (1987). \u201cField Inspection Guide for Restoration of Jointed 1.

        "title": "LockedWheelTesterLWT",
        "content": "Locked-Wheel Tester (LWT) Target of Investigation The locked-wheel test is used to measure the skid resistance of pavement. Description Skid resistance is an important pavement evaluation parameter. Adequate skid resistance is needed to reduce the risk of skid-related crashes. In the United States, a locked-wheel tester (figure 1) is the most common method of measuring skid resistance. A typical measurement system for a locked-wheel skid includes a test vehicle with one or more test wheels incorporated into it or as part of a towed trailer. Ribbed or smooth tires can be used. (1) A ribbed tire is more sensitive to microtexture changes in the pavement, while a smooth tire is more sensitive to pavement macrotexture. American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) M 261 and ASTM E501 define the standard ribbed tire for the test; ASTM E524 defines the standard smooth tire. (2\u20134) The vehicle (or trailer) is brought to the desired testing speed, and water is sprayed ahead of the test tire to create a wet pavement surface. The test tire\u2019s braking system is actuated to lock the test tire. Instrumentation within the locked- wheel tester measures the friction force acting between the test tire and pavement and reports the result as a skid number. \u00a9 2009 AASHTO. Figure 1. Photo. Locked-wheel tester (trailer). (1) This photo is of a locked-wheel tester on a trailer attached to the rear of a vehicle. The left wheel is shown in the center of the picture. Physical Principle The locked-wheel test measures the skid resistance as a friction coefficient or skid number. As shown in figure 2, L is the load perpendicular to the interface. Once the test wheel is locked, a friction force (F) takes place on the interface of the locked wheel and the road surface.\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.png]\n\u00a9 2009 AASHTO. Figure 2. Diagram. Forces acting on a locked test wheel. This diagram is a schematic showing the forces acting on a locked wheel. The outline of the wheel is in the center of the diagram. A straight horizontal line at the bottom of the wheel represents the road surface. A vertical arrow pointing down to the center of the wheel is marked \u201cWheel Load, L.\u201d A horizontal arrow pointing right from the center of the wheel is marked \u201cDirection of motion.\u201d A horizontal arrow pointing to the left under the road surface is marked \u201cFriction Force, F.\u201d Figure 3. Equation. Friction coefficient. f equals the quotient of F divided by L. Where f is the friction coefficient. Figure 4. Equation. Skid number. SN equals 100 times f. Where SN is the skid number. Data Acquisition A standard locked-wheel test can be performed according to AASHTO T 242, Standard Method of Test for Frictional Properties of Paved Surfaces Using a Full-Scale Tire, or ASTM E274, Standard Test Method for Skid Resistance of Paved Surfaces Using a Full-Scale Tire. (5,6) According to ASTM E274, approximately 0.5s after the beginning of the water delivery, the test wheel\u2019s brake should be applied to lock the wheel completely. (6) The wheel should remain locked for the duration of the data-averaging interval, which starts not less than 0.2s after the start of the wheel lockup. The interval should not be less than 1.0 or more than 3.0s. The data in the interval are averaged, and the mean value is used to estimate the skid number. Water delivery may be terminated as soon as the brake is released. Data Processing\nThe friction coefficient and skid number are calculated with the equations in figure 3 and figure 4. Data Interpretation Data are usually presented in a tabular format. Agencies generally establish thresholds for the friction coefficient and skid number. If the test results are below these thresholds, the agency will investigate potential friction concerns. Advantages Advantages of locked-wheel testers include the following: Systems are user friendly and relatively simple. Testing is not time consuming. Testers operate at near highway speeds. Lane closures are usually not necessary. Limitations Limitations of locked-wheel testers include the following: The test can only be used on straight segments (no curves, T-sections, or roundabouts). (1) The test is a sample-based testing procedure. At 40 mi/h (65 km/h), the test reports the average skid resistance of approximately 60 ft (18 m) of road. Friction characteristics vary along the road surface; thus, the test may not be conducted in the location of interest. The skid resistance is only valid for the test speed. The relationships between skid resistance and speed need to be determined by repeated measurements under different speeds for the same sections of the road. (7) The test only measures skid resistance at a 100-percent slip ratio. References National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. (2009). Guide for Pavement 1.

        "title": "MagneticPulseInductionMPI",
        "content": "Magnetic Pulse Induction (MPI) Target of Investigation Magnetic pulse induction has the following two primary applications for use in pavements: Determination of the thickness of concrete and asphalt pavements. Evaluation of dowel placement in unreinforced-concrete pavement. Description Magnetic pulse induction applications are based on magnetic pulse induction, but they do not use the same equipment. Pavement Thickness Sufficient slab thickness is critical to the long-term performance of concrete and asphalt pavements because even a small deficit in thickness can significantly reduce a pavement\u2019s service life. The current, typical method for determining pavement thickness is to take core samples, which is destructive and costly. Using Magnetic Pulse Induction is less expensive, faster, and nondestructive; it can also be done more frequently and on a larger scale, resulting in a more robust statistical analysis. (2) Since metallic reference plates need to be placed on the base before paving, this method is limited to quality control and acceptance testing during construction of new pavements or life- cycle evaluation in pavements in which the disks were installed during construction. (1) Magnetic Pulse Induction can be used as soon as the pavement is solid enough for foot traffic. (2) This method can be used on both asphalt and concrete pavements, but it cannot be used if steel reinforcement is present. (1) The typical Magnetic Pulse Induction system used to accurately measure the thickness of both asphalt and concrete pavements is simple, widely used, nondestructive, and cost efficient. (3) The system consists of a handheld device with a magnetic induction coil, sensors mounted in a rolling base, reference plates and a built-in processing computer (figure 1).. The method eliminates biases caused by variations in the properties of concrete and asphalt materials and can measure thicknesses up to 20 inches (508 mm). (1) The system cannot be used accurately in the presence of other metal objects. The reference plates vary based on the material of the pavement; aluminum plates and foils are used with asphalt, and galvanized steel plates are used with concrete. (4) The system\u2019s manufacturer supplies precalibrated plates.\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_1.jpeg]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_3.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_5.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_6.jpeg]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_8.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_10.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_12.png]\nSource: FHWA. Figure 1. Photo. Magnetic pulse induction system being used to measure pavement thickness. (1) This photo shows a worker using the magnetic pulse induction system on a concrete pavement. The worker is standing and holding the handle of the magnetic pulse induction system. The sensor is a small box at the end of the handle. The box is in contact with the surface of the\nconcrete pavement. Dowel Placement Using properly sized and positioned dowels is important for jointed concrete pavements subjected to heavy truck loads to prevent the development of roughness caused by faulting. Misaligned dowels can cause joints to lock, leading to spalling and cracking, and severe misalignments can cause looseness around the dowels under the joint, greatly reducing their effectiveness. Improper centering of the dowels under the joint can also severely impact the proper embedment length required on either side of the joint. (5) Magnetic Pulse Induction can be used to evaluate newly constructed or existing concrete pavements and to monitor and adjust the pavement process during construction. (6) The presence of other metal objects, such as tie bars, nails in the joint, coins, and pieces of wire, in the vicinity of the joint being tested severely limits the method. (6) The typical Magnetic Pulse Induction system used to determine the position and orientation of dowels embedded in concrete pavements is simple, purpose built, nondestructive, and efficient. (5) The system consists of a sensor unit and an onboard computer(figure 2). (6) The system is based on the principle of magnetic imaging tomography. The system is rolled along the joint on tracks placed for data collection and requires less than 1 min to scan one joint. The field data analysis is fully automated and performed by the onboard computer. (6) The data analysis algorithms determine the position of the metal dowels in the pavement. (5) This photo is of the magnetic pulse induction system resting on the surface of a concrete pavement. The sensor is in a rectangular box that is\nin contact with the pavement surface. On the box is a computer with a touch screen display. Source: FHWA. Figure 2. Photo. Magnetic pulse induction system for determining dowel placement. (6) This photo shows the reference plate placed on the base before paving using a powder actuated guns. Physical Principle Systems for pavement thickness measurement and dowel placement are based on Magnetic Pulse Induction, by which the responses of the investigated objects to external fields are measured in space and time. These signals contain information on the distribution of electrical conductivity and magnetic properties of the investigated objects, allowing for determination of their position, size, shape, and orientation. (6) Pavement Thickness The typical Magnetic Pulse Induction system for measuring pavement thickness uses a pulsed induction method based on electromagnetic eddy current technology, which has high noise immunity. The measurement sensor contains a transmission coil that generates a time-dependent magnetic field (emission field) that penetrates the pavement layer. A reference plate is preplaced at the bottom of this layer. The pulsating magnetic field induces eddy currents in the reflector that subside exponentially and generate a time-dependent magnetic field. Several sensors in the measuring probe assess the response field in its time course. Alternately switching the current on and off in very short intervals generates the emission field. To avoid an overlap between the response and emission fields, the response field is measured once the emission field has completely subsided. Measurement data are collected by a defined pass over the reflector, during which each of the four receiving sensors collects up to 150 position-dependent measurement points. The signals received depend on the relative position of the instrument to the reflector and the reflector\u2019s shape, size, and material. The relationships between these parameters and the measured signal are precisely determined during the manufacturer\u2019s calibration. (3) AASHTO and ASTM provided standard methods of tests for pavement thickness by magnetic pulse induction. (8,9) Dowel Placement The typical Magnetic Pulse Induction system for determining the position and orientation of dowels uses pulse induction. The device emits a weak, pulsating magnetic signal and detects the transient magnetic response signal induced in the dowels. The weak magnetic field emitted by the system is harmless to the surrounding area and does not affect the physical properties of the dowels or the concrete. The response signals are measured with high precision using special receivers in the\ndevice, and the detected signals\u2019 values are recorded at a relatively high sampling rate to assure large quantities of data for mathematical evaluation. This enables evaluation of measurements taken under less-than-ideal circumstances, such as in the presence of foreign metal or magnetic aggregates. (6) ASTM E3013 covers the equipment, field procedures, and interpretation methods for the assessment of dowel alignment in concrete pavements using Magnetic Pulse Induction. (7) Data Acquisition Pavement Thickness Operation of the system consists of the following two phases: (1) Prior to concrete placement\u2014reference plates are placed at desired locations on the 1. surface of the base (figure 3). The reflectors need to be fastened to the base. Common powder actuated guns are commonly used to fasten them down. Reference plates should be placed away from dowels and tie bars.\nSource: FHWA. Figure 3. Photo. Placement of reference plate on base before paving. (1) This photo shows a worker using the magnetic pulse induction system on a concrete pavement. The worker is standing and holding the handle of the magnetic pulse induction system. The sensor is a small box at the end of the handle. The box is in contact with the surface of the concrete pavement.\" Following concrete placement\u2014Testing can be conducted as soon as the concrete is solid 2. enough for foot traffic. This phase involves the following three steps: Assemble the device. a. Locate the reflector using both the approximate marked location and a more accurate b. locator built into the system. Scan over the reflector. Once the location of the reflector is determined, the system is c. moved over the reflector at a steady speed (figure 1). Immediately after the scan is\ncomplete, a calculated thickness is displayed and recorded. Ideally, five measurements should be taken at each reference plate and the average value used. Source: FHWA. Figure 4. Photo. Magnetic Pulse Induction system being used to measure pavement thickness.(1) (1) This photo shows a worker performing magnetic pulse induction on the joint of a concrete pavement.. A sensor is being pushed along the tracks by a worker. Dowel Placement Operation of the system consists of the following steps: (6) Ensure the system is ready before deployment. This preparation includes charging the system 1. and ensuring enough flash storage is available for new data.\nSource: FHWA. Figure 5. Photo. Magnetic pulse induction system scanning a joint to determine dowel placement. (6) This screen capture shows the output display of a magnetic pulse induction system. The figure has two columns. The first column is a color- coded map that identifies areas of greater signal strength with darker colors. The map has 12 evenly spaced dark-red areas. The second\ncolumn shows the positions of the 12 dowels from a side view. The dowels are evenly distributed, but the diagrams indicate some side shift and/or misalignment. The next column includes data measurements such as depth and side shift for each of the 12 dowels, as well as horizontal and vertical misalignment. The last column provides the station information and a legend for both the contour map and for the data measurements. Pull the system along the joint to collect data. Data are automatically collected and processed 2. (figure 4). Data Processing Acquired data can be used to produce reports for both Magnetic Pulse Induction applications. Pavement Thickness No data processing is required beyond averaging multiple measurements at a single test location. The measurements are delivered in real time and can be printed in a basic report using a pocket printer. (3) Dowel Placement No data processing is required for ideal circumstances, because the analysis appears on the screen and can be printed. (5) For other conditions, such as the presence of foreign metal or magnetic aggregates, accompanying computer software can be used to conduct more comprehensive analyses. Software give the user greater control over the analysis process. (6) Data Interpretation Users require related experiences and knowledge to interpret processed data. Pavement Thickness The measured values of the pavement thickness by the Magnetic Pulse Induction system are accurate to within 0.1 inches (2.54 mm) according to U.S. field trials and have acceptable accuracy and repeatability for quality assurance testing. Dowel Placement The results are accurate if no foreign metal objects are within 3 ft (0.9 m) of the dowels being scanned. The graphical output of the system consists of a contour map displaying the signal strength for each dowel and a diagram showing the side views of each dowel\u2019s actual position relative to its specified location (figure 5).

        "content": "Magnetometer (MM) Target of Investigation Magnetometer is an instrument mainly used to detect rebar size, rebar orientation, rebar location, rebar depth (concrete cover depth). Magnetometer is also commonly used to obtain as-built information on embedded rebar when there are no record drawings available. Though magnetometers cannot detect corrosion directly, their ability to measure cover is helpful; lower cover increases the ability for concrete to deteriorate and expose steel to oxygen and moisture. Description The first magnetometers, known as \u201ccovermeters,\u201d \u201cprofometer,\u201d or \u201cpachometers,\u201d were manufactured in the 1950s. Prior to the mid-1980s, magnetometers were built based on the magnetic reluctance principle. (1) More recent devices have been manufactured according to the concept of electrical conductivity to offer better system stability for detecting ferrous and nonferrous metals inside concrete. Magnetometer is commonly used in conjunction with other NDE technologies. For example, for tests requiring a concrete core sample or contact with embedded steel reinforcement through drilling a hole, a magnetometer can help the drill miss any reinforcement. Additionally, a magnetometer can quickly and easily handle construction inspection quality control for recently-constructed bridges if, for example, there is a question about adequate cover (e.g., determining if a rebar cage floated up during the concrete pour). Physical Principle Magnetometers are based on an electromagnetic field and are unaffected by nonconductive materials such as concrete, composite, and timber. The eddy current principal charges a primary coil, creating a magnetic field. Eddy currents are produced on the surface of any electrically conductive material in the vicinity of the magnetic field. The eddy currents induce a magnetic field in the opposite direction of the primary coil field. This opposition affects the measured impedance in the coil. Reinforcing bars that are closer to the probe or are larger produce a stronger magnetic field. They operate at frequencies above 1 kHz. The magnetic induction principle is similar to that of a transformer. Primary coils are charged while a secondary set of coils pick up the voltage transferred by the magnetic circuit created by the primary coils and rebar. Magnetometers based on magnetic induction are less sensitive than ones using eddy current principles. Regardless of the principle used, the size, orientation, and location of the rebar (concrete cover) affect voltage measurement, in terms of amplitude and phase difference. (1,2) Magnetometers using induction operate at frequencies below 90 Hz. When an electrically conductive material, e.g., steel rebar inside concrete, is subjected to a changing magnetic field, eddy currents are generated along the material\u2019s surface. The eddy currents induce a magnetic field in an opposite direction of the initially introduced magnetic field that causes a voltage change in one or more coils or sensors inside the probe. The voltage change is a function of the rebar size, location, and orientation. The voltage change, in terms of amplitude and phase difference, is measured and analyzed to estimate rebar size, location (concrete cover), and orientation. Data Acquisition\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_1.jpeg]\nA magnetometer consists of a magnetic probe and a data processor with a display screen. In some equipment, the probe, data processor, and display screen are integrated into a single lightweight, hand-held device. The probe is moved along the surface of a concrete deck or girder. As the operator moves the probe, he/she can observe magnetic field changes on the screen in either a digital or graphical form. Rebar orientation can be determined through a planar rotation of the probe at the concrete surface. The longitudinal axis of the probe is aligned with the direction of the rebar when a maximum value of the magnetic field is indicated on the screen of the magnetometer. Mapping rebar in concrete decks may be accomplished by scanning the concrete surface with the probe in different directions (figure 1). The operator marks the concrete surface when the location and orientation of each rebar are determined. (3) Some commercially available equipment has the capability to map rebar in concrete decks and display a rebar grid on the screen. The data may be recorded and saved for post-processing and documentation. Figure 1. Photo. Locating a Rebar with a Magnetometer (Profometer). Locating a Rebar with a Magnetometer (Profometer). A worker is kneeling on a concrete deck. His right hand is moving a hand-held probe on the deck. The probe is attached to a small instrument panel resting on the deck. The worker is observing the instrument panel. Data Processing All data processing is performed internally by the data processor component of the equipment. As such, no significant data manipulation is required by the operator. The data processor is programmed to compare detected magnetic field changes with those from known rebar sizes at different depths inside concrete to make an estimate of the rebar size and location.\nData Interpretation Magnetometers are simple to operate, with minimal operator training required. However, experience is required to interpret the results in complex cases (e.g., dense rebar placement). To minimize the effect of the nearby ferromagnetic materials, the maximum depth of concrete cover should be limited to about two-thirds of the distance between two adjacent bars. When both the rebar size and concrete cover are unknown, the operator must assume a value for one (usually the rebar size) to estimate the other unknown parameter. Advantages Provides rapid information about rebar size, orientation, or concrete cover. Field-worthy equipment. Easy to operate equipment, with minimal operator training required. Audible output with available headset option for working in noisy environments. Some systems applicable to non-ferrous metals, e.g., stainless steel bars. Relatively inexpensive and commercially available equipment. Limitations Only effective within top 4 inches of the concrete surface. Only first layer of reinforcing steel may be located and sized. Decreased effective depth as rebar spacing decreases. For a concrete cover estimate to be accurate, the parallel rebar spacing must be 1.5 times greater than the concrete cover. Ineffective in regions of congested reinforcing steel. Difficult data interpretation when there is interference due to the presence of other magnetic materials such as adjacent parallel rebar, external magnetic field, and magnetic aggregates in concrete. For prestressed concrete bridge girder applications, only effective only within a depth equal to two-thirds of the parallel strand spacing. Time intensive for rebar mapping.

        "content": "Microphones (MP) Target of Investigation Noise can be defined as unwanted or unpleasant sound. Road noise affects people in residences and businesses as well as people in vehicles. Microphones can be used to measure road-surface, engine, and aerodynamic noise. Description Noise generated by passing vehicles comes from three sources: air passing over and around the vehicle; the operation of the engine, exhaust, and drivetrain systems; and tire\u2013pavement interactions. (1,2) Tire\u2013pavement noise can be measured by two test methods: the close proximity (CPX) method and the onboard sound intensity (OBSI) method. (3) The CPX method uses directional microphones inside an acoustically insulated, enclosed space built on a trailer towed behind a vehicle (figure 1). OBSI measurement uses directional microphones placed at the leading and trailing edges of the tire\u2013pavement contact patch, just above the pavement (figure 2). \u00a9 2009 AASHTO..A CPX test trailer. Figure 1. Photos. CPX test trailer. (4) This photo is a closeup view of microphones installed close to the tire on the frame of the close proximity test trailer. \u00a9 2009 AASHTO.B. Closeup view of microphones. This photo shows a close proximity test trailer with the side cover open.

Figure 2. Photo. OBSI equipment. (4) This photo is of an onboard sound intensity system. The system is installed close to the wheel of a vehicle that is on asphalt pavement. Two microphones are suspended in the air on the outer side of the wheel. The statistical pass-by (SPB) method measures noise from the roadside with microphones (figure 3). This method measures combined noise from vehicle engines, exhausts, and other sources. \u00a9 2018 Acoustic Engineering Dresden. Figure 3. Photo. Measuring roadside noise. (5) This photo is of microphones measuring roadside noise. A truck is driving on the road. Two microphones mounted on tripods are on the near side of the road. Physical Principle A microphone, which measures air pressure changes as sound waves pass by, is a transducer that detects sound (acoustic signal) and transforms it to a voltage or current that is proportional to the sound signal. Based on the way a microphone transforms an acoustic signal to an electrical signal, a\nmicrophone can be either a condenser, dynamic, or piezoelectric microphone. A condenser microphone uses a capacitor to transform an acoustic signal into an electrical signal (figure 4). The sound pressure changes the spacing between a thin metallic membrane and the stationary back plate. The membrane and plate act as a capacitor when connected to a battery and resistor. A change in the plate spacing because of sound pressure causes a change in the capacitance, which forces a current through the resistor. \u00a9 2018 DEWESoft\u00ae. Figure 4. Illustration. Physical principle of a condenser microphone. (6) This illustration is a two-dimensional schematic of a condenser microphone. The input of the microphone is to the left. The narrower output is to the right. Sound waves enter the microphone on the left and encounter a front plate (diaphragm) and then a back plate. The output audio signal exits the microphone on the right. The illustration also indicates the microphone battery between the back plate and the signal output. A dynamic microphone takes advantage of electromagnetic effects (figure 5). A diaphragm is connected to either a magnet or a coil. When the sound waves excite the diaphragm, the relative movement between the magnet and coil induces an electrical current in the wire.\n\u00a9 2018 DEWESoft\u00ae. Figure 5. Illustration. Physical principle of a dynamic microphone. (6) This illustration is a two-dimensional schematic of a dynamic microphone. The input of the microphone is to the left, where sound waves enter the microphone and encounter a diaphragm. To the right of the diaphragm is a coil and then a magnet. Wires carrying electrical audio signals exit the right side of the microphone. A piezoelectric microphone features a sensitive crystal that respond to the physical vibration of acoustic signals by creating an electrical output (figure 6). \u00a9 2018 DEWESoft\u00ae. Figure 6. Illustration. Physical principle of a piezoelectric microphone. (6) This illustration is a two-dimensional schematic of a piezoelectric microphone. The microphone is rectangular in shape. The top is a crystal with horizontal electrodes near its top and bottom surfaces. Sound waves descend to the crystal. Output voltage exits from the electrodes and to the right Data Acquisition The procedures for measuring tire\u2013pavement noise using the CPX method can be found in ISO\n11819-2, Acoustics \u2013 Measurement of the influence of road surfaces on traffic noise \u2013 Part 2: The close-proximity method. (7) The procedures for measuring tire\u2013pavement noise using the OBSI method can be found in AASHTO TP 76, Standard method of test for measurement of tire/pavement noise using the on-board sound intensity (OBSI) method. (8) The procedures for measuring the influence of road surfaces on highway traffic noise at a specific site by using the SPB method can be found in ISO 11819-1, Acoustics \u2012 Measurement of the influence of road surfaces on traffic noise \u2012 Part 1: Statistical Pass-By method. (9) A signal acquisition system can be used to collect and store the data. For OBSI and CPX tests, data are collected continuously as the vehicle moves on the road surface. For SPB tests, data are collected for a time period for a certain group of vehicles travelling at a certain speed. Data Processing For CPX and OBSI methods, noise is time-sequence data and can be processed to identify the noise level at different areas of a pavement. For an individual test section, a single overall sound\u2011intensity level is often cited. This value is usually expressed in A-weighted decibels (dBA), representing an average over the length of the test section. A-weighting represents an approximation of sound or noise perceived by the human ear. The sound-intensity spectrum provides the frequency content to inspect tire\u2013pavement noise. For the SPB method, data are correlated to vehicle types and speeds by statistical analyses. (10) For each vehicle category, the maximum pass-by noise levels are regressed against the logarithm of vehicle speed. The SPB level for each vehicle category is defined as the ordinate of the regression line at the reference speed for the road category. The sound-intensity spectrum may also be reported for different vehicle categories at the reference speed. Data Interpretation A larger test result usually indicates a higher noise level of the pavement. CPX and OBSI levels can be calculated using short interval averages and plotted as a function of distance along the road (figure 7). SPB results for each segment of road can be shown in a tabular form for different categories of vehicles at the reference speed. \u00a9 2011 The Transtec Group, Inc.1 ft = 0.3 m. Figure 7. Graph. OBSI sound pressure level versus distance showing variability over the test section. (11) This graph shows results from an onboard sound-intensity test. The x-axis represents distance in feet, ranging from 0 to 700. The y-axis\nrepresents the A-weighted noise level acquired at a speed of 60 miles per hour in decibels with a reference of 1 picoWatt per square meter, ranging from 105 to 112 decibels. The plotted curve begins and ends with y-axis readings of a little more than 106 decibels. Between those two points, the curve rises to a maximum of approximately y equals 110.5 decibels and has several peaks and troughs. Advantages Advantages of using microphones to measure noise include the following: The SPB method can eliminate the variability of noise emissions from different vehicles within each type. (5) The SPB method measures near the receptors along a roadway and is more representative of actual traffic conditions. (5) CPX and OBSI methods measure at arbitrary locations and continuously along sections of road. (5) Limitations Limitations of using microphones to measure noise include the following: For the SPB method, the road section to be tested must be flat, straight, and at an open location with no large reflective objects in the immediate vicinity. (5) Because SPB test measurements are taken at a specific location, the results can only be related to short test sections of road surface. Heterogeneous surface texture cannot be evaluated. (5) CPX and OBSI methods do not take into consideration noise sources other than tire\u2013pavement interaction noise. References Nelson, P.M. and Phillips, S.M.

        "content": "Nuclear Density Gauge (NDG) Target of Investigation The nuclear density gauge is a rapid, nondestructive device primarily used to measure the density of in\u2011place earthworks, granular and stabilized pavement materials, and hot mix asphalt (HMA) during construction and service life. (1\u20133) Specific applications include the following: Conducting quality control and, on some occasions, quality acceptance during construction. Establishing effective rolling effort and pattern to achieve proper density. Estimating the density and/or moisture content of an existing exposed material. Description Density is a critical property of compacted materials that can be related to the long-term performance of pavements. The most accurate method for determining the density of a pavement is to extract cores and test them in a laboratory, but this method is expensive and time consuming. (4) The nuclear density gauge (figure 1) is a portable, rapid, and virtually nondestructive alternative. (5) \u00a9 2018 Pavement Interactive. Figure 1. Photo. Nuclear density gauge. (4) This a photo is of a nuclear density gauge on an asphalt pavement. The gauge consists of a box with a handle, display, and keyboard on top. As shown in figure 2, the nuclear density gauge consists of a handle, a retractable rod, a frame, a Cesium-137 (Cs-137) source and Geiger\u2013Mueller detector for density measurements, and an Americium-241 (Am-241) neutron source and Helium-3 (He-3) tube detector for moisture content measurements.

(1\u20133,7) Manufacturers are required to provide safety materials, and operators are required to complete training courses for safe use of the system. Physical Principle The nuclear density gauge measures the decay of Cs-137 by recording the count rate of the radiation transmitted directly through the pavement material from the Cs-137 source to the Geiger\u2013Mueller tubes. These counts are then translated to the wet density of the material through a calibration process. (7) High-energy (fast) neutrons are emitted by an Am-241 radiation source and detected and counted by the He-3 tube. The fast neutrons are slowed by interactions with hydrogen atoms. (6) A wetter material will slow a greater number of neutrons; the gauge counts the rate of slow neutrons to measure the moisture content. The device is placed on the surface of the pavement, and the sources and appropriate detectors are activated to measure the number of gamma rays and neutrons. Direct Transmission In direct transmission mode (figure 3-A), the retractable rod is lowered from its protective sheathing into the pavement through a predrilled hole. The source emits gamma rays; those that maintain sufficient energy are counted by the detector. The denser the material is, the lower the detector\u2019s count will be. This method is generally effective up to depths of 300 mm (12 inches). (6,7)\nBackscatter In backscatter mode (figure 3-B), the retractable rod is lowered from its protective sheathing but only until it is even with the detector. The source emits gamma rays; those that scatter back in the direction of the detector are counted. This method is generally effective up to depths of 75\u2013100 mm (3\u20134 inches).

As the body of the gauge sits on the pavement surface, the retractable rod is lowered from its protective sheathing into the pavement through a predrilled hole. The Cesium-137 source is located at the tip of the rod and emits gamma rays, which are represented by lines in the pavement. Two circles in the gauge are labeled \u201cGeiger\u2013Mueller tubes.\u201d They receive the gamma rays. \u00a9 2009 American Portable Nuclear Gauge Association.B. Backscatter transmission. This two-dimensional illustration is of a nuclear density gauge engaged in backscatter transmission. The gauge is resting on pavement. Immediately under the gauge is a semicircle representing the hemisphere area of measurement, the size of which depends on the hydrogen content in the pavement. Data Acquisition Detailed procedures for the operation of specific nuclear density gauges are supplied by manufacturers, and procedures for using the devices are given in the following ASTM standards: ASTM D6938, Standard Test Methods for In-Place Density and Water Content of Soil and Soil Aggregate by Nuclear Methods (Shallow Depth). (1) ASTM D2950/D2950M, Standard Test Method for Density of Bituminous Concrete in Place by\nNuclear Methods. (2) ASTM C1040/C1040M, Standard Test Methods for In-Place Density of Unhardened and Hardened Concrete, Including Roller Compacted Concrete, by Nuclear Methods. (3) These ASTM standards provide extensive details on the use of the devices (including recommended distances to vertical surfaces and other devices, appropriate air gaps between the device and the surface, and other factors). Before testing, calibration and standardization procedures should be performed to ensure accurate measurement with nuclear density gauges. A standardization check should be performed at the beginning of each work day and include taking reference measurements on a standard block to ensure the device\u2019s gamma ray counts correlate to the correct densities. Figure 4 shows a gauge in use. Simplified procedures for direct transmission and backscatter modes follow. \u00a9 2018 Pavement Interactive. Figure 4. Photo. Nuclear density gauge in use. (9) This photo is of a worker using a nuclear density gauge. The worker is bending over the nuclear density gauge, which is a box with a steel rod sitting on the asphalt pavement. Direct Transmission The following are steps for using the gauge in direct transmission mode: Select a test location of interest. 1. Use the guide plate and a hole-forming device (usually a steel rod on unhardened surfaces and 2. a drill on hardened surfaces) to make a perpendicular hole for the source rod probe. Insert the probe so that the side facing the gauge is in contact with the side of the hole (do not 3. insert the probe until the device is sitting on the surface). Perform the warmup procedure as indicated in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 4. Take the in-place density reading following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 5. Retract the source rod probe. 6. Return the device to its protective case when not in use (i.e., between measurements). Backscatter The following are steps for using the gauge in backscatter mode:\nSelect a proper test location. 1. Seat the gauge firmly against the surface to ensure maximum contact between the device and 2. the material. Perform the warmup procedure as indicated in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 3. Take the in-place density reading following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 4. Return the device to its protective case when not in use (i.e., between measurements). Data Processing Nuclear density gauges directly report the density and moisture content (when appropriate) if the device is properly calibrated for the testing material. Accurate values are achieved only by applying the calibration procedures on known samples in the laboratory and a field check on a test strip. The following factors may interfere with density measurements: (1\u20133) Density of the underlying material, especially when measuring HMA overlays (most significant in backscatter mode). Presence of reinforcing steel. Sample heterogeneity. Chemical composition of the test material. Spatial bias; the gauge is more sensitive to the material closest to the source. Surface roughness. Oversize aggregate particles in the source detector path. Data Interpretation Measurements provided by a nuclear density gauge can be used to determine the relative density and, if applicable, the moisture content during construction. In order to calculate the relative density, the maximum density should be determined in a laboratory and entered into the device before initiating the tests. Advantages Advantages of nuclear density gauges include the following: Is portable enough for one operator. Produces results in a matter of minutes. Is completely nondestructive in the backscatter mode. Provides simultaneous density and moisture content for granular materials. Limitations Limitations of nuclear density gauges include the following: Radioactive source material is a safety hazard. State and Federal permits are required for use and transport. Operator training is required. References ASTM D6938.

        "content": "Photometric Stereo Imaging (PSI) Target of Investigation Photometric stereo imaging is employed to detect surface cracks and surface textures of pavements. Description Unlike stereography, which uses two cameras, photometric stereo imaging uses a single camera and multiple light sources at fixed locations to determine local surface orientation (figure 1). The amount of light reflected by a surface is dependent on the orientation of the surface in relation to the light source and observer. (1) By having light sources at different angles, photometric stereo imaging produces images based on variations in shading of individual pixels. It also enables determination of surface orientation. \u00a9 2018 Earth Radar Pty Ltd. Figure 1. Photo. Vehicle-mounted photometric stereo imaging system. (2) This photo shows photometric stereo imaging being performed on concrete pavement. The photometric stereo imaging system is installed at the rear of a vehicle. Red light-emitting diodes set at different angles to the pavement surface are illuminating the pavement. Physical Principle As shown in figure 2, the surface normal at a local point is n. If the surface is diffusive, the surface albedo (k) is defined as the ratio of the reflection to the incident light. (3) Three illumination rays from\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_14.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_16.png]\ndifferent light sources are of unit vector intensity and in different planes. (4,5) The direction vectors are noted as l1, l2, and l3. Sources illuminate individually, and the light intensities observed by the camera are i1, i2, and i3 corresponding to l1, l2, and l3, respectively. The relationships between the observed intensities and the sources can be expressed by the equation in figure 3. Source: FHWA. Figure 2. Illustration. Principle of photometric stereo imaging. This illustration is a schematic of the principle of photometric stereo. The x-axis points to the lower left, the y-axis points to the right, and the z-axis points upward. A surface is in the x\u2013y plane. A camera is facing downward on the z-axis. Three circles represent three light sources, and arrows to the light sources from the x-y-z origin indicate their directions. A dashed arrow from the origin to the upper right indicates the direction of the surface normal. Figure 3. Equation. Observed intensities, light source directions, and surface normal. Open parenthesis i subscript 1, i subscript 2, i subscript 3 close parenthesis equals k times open parenthesis l subscript 1, l subscript 2, l subscript 3 close parenthesis times n. k is an assumed known value for pavement surface materials (asphalt or concrete). The observed intensities and directions of light sources can be obtained from the test. n can be solved for using the equation in figure 3. Figure 4 shows the matrix form of the equation in figure 3, and n can be solved for using the equation in figure 5. When there are more than three light sources, n can be solved for by making the least-squares errors in the equations, and the solution can be expressed in the matrix form shown in figure 6. (6) This model can also be extended to surfaces with nonuniform albedos. (7) Figure 4. Equation. Matrix form of observed intensities, light source directions, and surface normal.

Solving surface direction n when there are more than three light sources. Open parenthesis L superscript T times L close parenthesis to the negative 1 times L superscript T times I equals k times n. Where L T is transposed L. Data Acquisition The photometric stereo imaging system is usually integrated with a moving vehicle. Continuous imaging can be taken at highway speeds (100 km/hr [60 mph]), during which the photometric stereo imaging system will illuminate each light source in sequence at very high speeds. (8) A picture of the same area of the pavement surface is taken each time a light source is turned on. For example, a system with four light sources from different illumination angles will produce four images in sequence. The images will be captured by the charged coupled device of the camera and stored in the system\u2019s computer for postprocessing. Data Processing Image processing is usually done by software, and the surface normalization is provided by the software as an image. Data Interpretation Cracks and different textures that cannot be seen in conventionally illuminated imagery can be seen directly in gradient maps generated from photometric stereo imaging (figure 7). Cracks are shown as lines and curves, and different textures are shown as grains of different sizes for different illumination combinations. \u00a9 2018 Earth Radar Pty Ltd. A.

Cracks on the same pavement surface with different light sources. (2) This image is of the pavement surface when light was applied at a transverse angle. A few cracks appear as bright and dark lines. The manhole cover located at the bottom of the figure is bright. Advantages Advantages of photometric stereo imaging include the following: Noncontact method. High accuracy in detecting surface cracks. Imaging at highway speeds. Limitations A limitation of photometric stereo imaging is the following: Cannot detect cracking when the surface is wet or covered by dirt or debris. References Wu, Y. (n.d.).

        "content": "Sand Patch Test (SPT) Target of Investigation Pavement surface texture influences many different pavement\u2013tire interactions and can impact noise, drainage, ride quality, and safety. (1) The sand patch test is employed to measure the texture of the pavement surface. Description Texture wavelengths affect various pavement\u2013tire interactions, including friction, interior and exterior noise, splash and spray, rolling resistance, and tire wear. (2) The sand patch test is a field test that uses a volumetric approach to determine the average macrotexture depth of a pavement surface. A known volume of sand is spread evenly over the pavement surface to form a circle. The diameter of the circle is measured on four axes and the values are averaged (figure 1). This value is then used to calculate the mean texture depth (MTD). Source: FHWA. Figure 1. Photo. Sand patch test for measuring the macrotexture depth of pavement surfaces. (3) In this photo, a person is kneeling on asphalt pavement after spreading sand on the pavement. He is measuring the diameter of the circle of sand with a tape measure. Physical Principle In the sand patch test, the apertures between aggregates are filled with sand (figure 2). Assuming the sand is distributed in the pavement as a cylinder, the average texture depth can be calculated with the volume and area of the top surface of the cylinder. The equation for calculating average texture depth is given in figure 3. V is the volume of sand used in millimeters cubed (inches cubed). D is the average diameter of the sand patch circle in millimeters (inches).\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.png]\nSource: FHWA. Figure 2. Illustration. Pavement surface filled with sand. This schematic is a cut-away (two-dimensional) view of sand patch testing. The x-axis is distance, and the y-axis is wavelength. A shaded area represents a pavement with an irregular surface profile. The full x-axis distance of the pavement is the diameter of a sand patch. Dots represent sand particles, which fill the depressions in the surface profile. Figure 3. Equation. Average texture depth. Texture depth equals the quotient of 4 times V divided by pi times D squared. Data Acquisition The procedure for performing the sand patch test can be found in ASTM E965-15, Standard Test Method for Measuring Pavement Macrotexture Depth Using a Volumetric Technique. (4) The pavement surface is cleared of debris by sweeping the surface with a small brush. The test area is clear of cracking, and the pavement area must be dry. A known volume of sand is measured and then, using a measuring cylinder, poured onto the road surface to form a cone. The sand is spread with a spreading disc to form a circular patch. Horizontal forces are applied to the spreading disc and worked outward in a circular pattern until the surface depressions are filled to the level of the peaks. The sand is to be used only once. The diameter is measured at four different angles by rotating 45 degrees between each measurement. (2) The mean diameter is recorded. Data Processing Not much data processing is needed. The MTD is calculated by plugging the known sand volume and the average diameter of the sand disc into the equation in figure 3. Data Interpretation Data are usually presented in tabular format. A large MTD means a large size for the macrotexture of the pavement surface. Advantages\nAdvantages of sand patch tests include the following: Test procedure is simple. Result is of high certainty. Limitations Limitations of sand patch tests include the following: Test cannot be performed continuously for the pavement but must be performed at each individual test location, which can be a slow process. Traffic control and lane closure may be required. References Hibbs, B.O. and Larson, R.M. (1996). Tire Pavement Noise and Safety Performance, PCC 1.

        "title": "Sounding",
        "content": "Sounding Target of Investigation Sounding is a common method of surveying concrete structures for structural evaluation and repair purposes. (1) In tunnels, sounding is used to determine the following: The soundness of concrete linings (including determining the presence of delamination, shallow voids, and debonding). (2) The extent of each delamination of large horizontal surfaces if a chain drag is used to determine the general locations of delamination. (3) Description Different tools can be used to strike the surface of a tunnel wall to determine the soundness of the concrete lining. The impact will produce a high-pitched or ringing sound if the concrete is sound and free of defects. It will produce a dull thud or hollow sound if there is a potential defect below the surface. (4) Although sounding surveys are easy to conduct and require minimal equipment, the process is slow and the results subjective, varying between inspectors. Additionally, inspectors are subjected to working conditions for prolonged periods. (2,5) Because high levels of environmental noise, such as active tunnel traffic, may interfere with the operator\u2019s ability to hear the response, and ladders or other equipment may be required to reach some vertical and overhead locations, traffic control or shutdown is often required. (6,4) Rotary percussion tools that use gear-toothed wheels to produce uniform tapping while rolling along a surface can be mounted on telescoping poles to overcome some height limitations. (4) Sounding can detect late-stage delamination but not early-stage or deep delamination. (5) Hammer sounding is most effective for the top 4\u20136 inches (10.1\u201315.2 mm) of concrete. (4) Additionally, this method should not be employed on frozen concrete. (6) Figure 1 shows a worker using hammer sounding to inspect a tunnel after fire damage.\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_1.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_3.jpeg]\nSource: FHWA. Figure 1. Photo. Hammer sounding in a tunnel after fire damage. (7) This photo shows a worker squatting on a concrete floor and tapping the floor with a hammer.\" Physical Principle Hammer sounding is an elastic-wave test method in which the operator strikes the surface and listens to the resulting sound. The presence of a delamination or other defect changes the frequency of oscillations and the audible response of the surface. A clear, ringing sound indicates sound concrete, and a hollow, muted sound indicates a delamination. The hollow sound results from flexural oscillations of the delaminated concrete that create a drumlike effect; this sound is typically in a range of 1\u20133 kHz, which is within the audible range of the human ear. (2) Sounding can only detect significant delamination and cannot detect early-stage or deep delamination. (5) Data Acquisition The standard procedure for hammer sounding on concrete slabs is described in ASTM D4580/D4580M-12, Standard Practice for Measuring Delaminations in Concrete Bridge Decks by Sounding. (6) The steps for general application are as follows: Construct a grid system on the surface for ease of plotting delaminated areas that are marked 1. on the surface during evaluation. Impact the surface with the hammer; a dull or hollow sound is emitted when delaminated 2.\nconcrete is encountered. Outline areas of delamination on the surface. 3. Data Processing No data processing is needed, but areas with potential defects are marked on the concrete surface, as shown in figure 2. (6) \u00a9 2014 TRB. Figure 2. Photo. Map of debonded regions on a tunnel wall. (8) This photo shows a tiled tunnel wall divided by tape into three parts. There is an x made of tape in the central part, indicating an area of tile debonding.\" Data Interpretation Areas with potential defects, indicated on the surface and maps, can be used for further evaluation of the structure or for the removal and repair of the damaged areas. (1) Advantages Advantages of hammer sounding include the following: Accurate detection of significant shallow concrete delamination. Well-established testing specifications. Simple, low-cost equipment. Simple procedures for data collection and mapping. Effective for initial surveys and repairs. Limitations Limitations of hammer sounding include the following: Results are subjective. Experienced operators are required. Traffic control or shutdown are often necessary.\nEnvironmental noise can adversely affect performance. Detection of early or deep delamination is impossible. Manual testing is slow.

        "content": "Straightedge \u2013 Pavement Application (SE-P) Target of Investigation A straightedge is employed to measure the magnitude of rutting on asphalt pavements. Description Rutting is vertical depression along the wheelpath of a pavement surface. It is caused by permanent deformation of the pavement surface or the subgrade under the traffic load. Ruts filled with water can cause hydroplaning. They will also affect ride quality when a vehicle is moving laterally in a lane or changing lanes because ruts tend to pull the vehicle toward the rut path. A straightedge (figure 1) can be used to measure the magnitude of rutting in millimeters, so that action can be taken when the rut depth exceeds a certain level. Source: FHWA. Figure 1. Photo. Straightedge on a rutted asphalt pavement. (1) This photo shows a straightedge lying across two ridges, one on each side of a rut. A gap exists between the pavement surface at the bottom of the rut and the straightedge. Physical Principle The common method of measuring the magnitude of rutting on asphalt pavements is to place a 3\u2011 to 4-ft (0.9- to 1.2-m) straightedge across the wheelpath to measure its maximum rut depth. The straightedge works as a reference (figure 2). A tape measure (or ruler) is used to measure the maximum vertical distance between the pavement surface and the straightedge. The straightedge should be positioned at various locations on each half of the lane until the maximum displacement is found.\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_6.png]\nSource: FHWA. Figure 2. Illustration. Measuring rut depth based on straightedge reference. (2) This schematic is a two-dimensional, cutaway view of a lane in the transverse direction. The lane has two depressions (i.e., ruts): one on the left half of the lane and the other on the right. Each rut has a straightedge across it; the straightedges almost meet at the high point in the center of the lane. The depths of the ruts are the vertical distances from the straightedges to the bottoms of the ruts. The distance from the depth of each rut to the outside edgeline is labeled as the offset. Data Acquisition ASTM E1703/E1703M-10, Standard Test Method for Measuring Rut-Depth of Pavement Surfaces Using a Straightedge, lists the procedures for using the straightedge to measure rut depth. (3) The straightedge is placed across the rut in a plane perpendicular to the direction of traffic movement. The straightedge is allowed to rest upon the pavement at two contact areas such that sliding the straightedge along its length in both directions does not change the contact areas on the pavement. The bottom surface of the straightedge should be parallel to the longitudinal slope of the pavement. The measuring gauge is placed perpendicular to the reference plane created by the bottom of the straightedge and perpendicular to the longitudinal slope of the pavement. The bottom of the gauge should be in contact with the pavement at the time of measurement. The straightedge or gauge should not be placed on any discontinuities, such as potholes or loose debris, on the pavement surface. After the gauge has been placed, the distance between the bottom surface of the straightedge and the pavement is measured. A sufficient number of measurements should be made along the straightedge to determine the greatest distance between the straightedge and the pavement. Greater intervals between successive straightedge placements produce less precise results. Data Processing Little data processing is needed. Statistical analysis can be performed for the road segment to decide if corrective actions are needed. Data Interpretation The data are usually presented in tabular format. A rut depth larger than a certain value indicates heavy distress. Rut-depth data could also be presented in a graph (figure 3).\n\u00a9 2016 Shi Qiu.LDP = left road pavement;RDP = right road pavement;RD = rut depth.1 mm = 0.039 inches. Figure 3. Graph. Longitudinal profiles of rut depths on US 65 North. (4) This graph depicts rut depth data from US 65 North. The x-axis is longitudinal direction (profile sample number) and ranges from 0 to 5,000. The y-axis is rut depth in millimeters and ranges from 0 to 100. There are two plots on the graph. One plot is data from the left half of the lane, and the other plot is data from the right half of the lane. The graph depicts high rut depth for the sample numbers around 1,000. Generally, the rut depth of the right half of the lane is slightly larger than the rut depth of the left half of the lane. Advantages Advantages of straightedges include the following: Low-cost equipment. Simple data collection and processing. Limitations Limitations of straightedges include the following: Measurement is not continuous along the road. Traffic control and lane closure may be required.

There is a gap between the straightedge and the pavement surface at the bottom of the rut. Physical Principle The common method of measuring the magnitude of rutting is to place a 3- to 4-ft (0.9- to 1.2-m) straightedge across the wheelpath to measure its maximum rut depth. The straightedge works as a reference (figure 2). A tape measure (or ruler) is used to measure the maximum vertical distance between the road surface and the straightedge. The straightedge should be positioned at various locations on each half of the lane until the maximum displacement is found.\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.png]\nSource: FHWA. Figure 2. Illustration. Measuring rut depth based on straightedge reference. (2) This schematic is a two-dimensional, cut-away view of a lane in the transverse direction. The lane has two depressions (i.e., ruts): one on the left half of the lane and the other on the right. Each rut has a straightedge across it; the straightedges almost meet on the high point in the center of the lane. The depths of the ruts are labeled as the vertical distances from the straightedges to the bottoms of the ruts. The distance from the depth of each rut to the outside edgeline is labeled as the offset. Data Acquisition ASTM E1703/E1703M, Standard Test Method for Measuring Rut-Depth of Pavement Surfaces Using a Straightedge, lists the procedures for using the straightedge to measure rut depth. (3) The straightedge is placed across the rut in a plane perpendicular to the direction of traffic movement. The straightedge is allowed to rest upon the road surface at two contact areas such that sliding the straightedge along its length in both directions does not change the contact areas on the road surface. The bottom surface of the straightedge should be parallel to the longitudinal slope of the roadway. The measuring gauge is placed perpendicular to the reference plane created by the bottom of the straightedge and perpendicular to the longitudinal slope of the roadway. The bottom of the gauge should be in contact with the road surface at the time of measurement. The straightedge or gauge should not be placed on any discontinuities, such as potholes or loose debris. After the gauge has been placed, the distance between the bottom surface of the straightedge and the road surface is measured. A sufficient number of measurements should be made along the straightedge to determine the greatest distance between the straightedge and the road surface. Greater intervals between successive straightedge placements produce less precise results. Data Processing Little data processing is needed. Statistical analysis can be performed for the road segment to decide if corrective actions are needed. Data Interpretation The data are usually presented in tabular format. A large rut depth indicates heavy distress. The rut- depth profile could also be presented in a graph. Advantages\nAdvantages of straightedges include the following: Low-cost equipment. Simple data collection and processing. Limitations Limitations of straightedges include the following: Measurement is not continuous along the road. Traffic control and lane closure may be required.

        "content": "Traffic Speed Deflection Devices (TSDDs) Target of Investigation Traffic speed deflection devices (TSDDs) can assess the structural condition of pavement at a network level. They can help identify potentially damaged areas and provide targets for further detailed inspection and testing. TSDDs can be used for multiple applications, such as the following: Identifying weak sections of road surfaces. Detecting damage, such as delamination and voids. Estimating effective structural number (SNeff) which is an indicator of structural capacity of in-service pavement sections. Evaluating concrete pavement joints. Description Several organizations in the United States and Europe have developed TSDDs over the past several decades that can continuously measure pavement deflections at posted traffic speeds (up to 95 km/h [60 mi/h]). (1) The commonly used TSDDs is the traffic speed deflectometer (TSD). The TSD is an articulated truck with a variable rear axle load, typically 80 kN (18 kips). It employs a series of Doppler-shift lasers to measure the velocity and slope of the deflecting road surface. The processed TSD measurements produce continuous profiles of deflection and deflection slope. (2) The TSD can test approximately 300\u2013500 lane-km (200\u2013300 lane-mi) per day. A TSD is shown in figure 1. \u00a9 2018 ARRB. Figure 1. Photo. TSD truck. (4) This photo is of a traffic speed deflectometer. The system is in the trailer of a truck. Physical Principle deflection velocity of a loaded pavement. (2,4) The Doppler lasers are positioned such that they\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_8.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_10.png]\nmeasure deflection velocity at a range of distances in front of the rear axle. For example, a TSD prototype had sensors at 4, 8, and 12 inches (100, 200, and 300 mm) in front of the rear axle to measure the deflection bowl, and another sensor at 3,600 mm (30 inches) from the rear axle to work as a reference outside the deflection bowl. (2) The Greenwood TSD 7 had sensors at 4, 8, 12, 15, 20, and 30 inches (100; 200; 300; 450; 600; 900; and 3,500 mm) ahead of the rear axle. (4) The beam on which the lasers are mounted moves up and down in opposition to the movement of the trailer in order to keep the lasers at a constant height from the pavement surface. To prevent thermal distortion of the steel measurement beam, a climate-control system maintains the trailer temperature at a constant 68\u2109 (20\u2103). (2) TSDs measure the vertical direction velocity of the pavement under a given load and integrate the velocity to get the deflection curve. The sensors of the Doppler lasers measure the deflection velocity of the pavement. The deflection of the pavement under a moving wheel load is illustrated in figure 2. Source: FHWA. Figure 2. Illustration. Deflection of pavement under moving wheel load. This illustration is a two-dimensional schematic of pavement surface deflection under a moving wheel load. A line bending downward in the middle represents the pavement surface. A circle contacting the pavement represents the wheel. A downward arrow from the center of the circle is the wheel load. An arrow pointing to the right represents the driving velocity of the wheel. Arrows pointing upward (left of the wheel load) and downward (right of the wheel load) near the wheel\u2019s contact with the pavement represent deflection velocity. The deflection slope is deflection velocity divided by vehicle velocity (figure 3 and figure 4). Because the slope of deflection is the derivative of displacement, the displacement of the pavement can then be determined. Data are recorded at a survey speed of up to 50 mi/h (80 km/h) at a rate of 1,000 Hz (i.e., a 0.8-inch [20-mm] spacing of the raw measurements). These results are usually reported as averages over 33-ft (10-m) sections. Figure 3. Equation. Calculation of deflection slope. slope equals the quotient of v subscript deflection divided by v subscript vehicle. Where: slope = deflection slope. vdeflection = deflection velocity. vvehicle = vehicle velocity. Source: FHWA. Figure 4. Illustration. Slope of the pavement under the wheel load.\nThis two-dimensional illustration depicts solving for the deflection slope. A line bending downward in the middle represents the deflected pavement surface under a moving wheel load. An arrow pointing to the right indicates the direction of the driving velocity. Perpendicular to the driving velocity arrow is an arrow pointing upward, indicating the deflection velocity. A line starting from the joint origin of the two arrows and extending upward to the right is the slope. More sensors with different frequencies and spacing are being applied on newer versions of TSDs. Data Acquisition Data are automatically collected and stored by TSD system at traffic speed. Data Processing The raw data collected by each sensor may contain undesirable noise. The common procedure with TSD data has been to determine an average over 33-ft (10-m) intervals. (2) Bearing-capacity characteristics can also be estimated based on deflection slopes. These include the center deflection and the surface curvature index SCI300, which equals the difference of the deflection at its center and the deflection at 12 inches (300 mm) from the center. Data Interpretation TSD results can be presented in a table or a profile graph. Postprocessed TSD results are presented in terms of deflection slopes. Low and uniform deflections or deflection slopes indicate good uniformity and structural conditions, while high and variable deflections or deflection slopes indicate poor conditions. Figure 5 is a TSD deflection-slope profile. \u00a9 2012 TRB.1 m = 3.3 ft;1 mm= 0.039 inches. Figure 5. Profile. TSD deflection slope profile. (2) This graph is of the deflection slope profile from a traffic speed deflectometer. The x-axis is distance ranging from 0 to 4,000 meters. The y-axis is deflection slope ranging from 0 to 1 millimeters per meter. A plotted line represents the averages over 10 meters, and another plotted line represents the averages over 100 meters. The 10-meter average plot is spiky, and the highest peak is at the distance of 1,000 meters. The\nrange of the 100-meter average plot narrows to between 0.23 and 0.55 millimeters per meter, and the two highest peaks appear at distances of 900 and 2,400 meters. Advantages Advantages of TSDDs include the following: Collects pavement condition and structural parameters in one pass. Operates at traffic speed. Increases operator and road-user safety. Offers more continuous data measurements than traditional methods such as falling weight deflectometers (discrete). Requires no traffic control, making it cost efficient. Allows flexibility in survey planning and network coverage. Limitations Limitations of TSDDs include the following: Data need spatial averaging for usable accuracy. (4) Results affected by temperature; correction is needed. (5) References Rada, G., Nazarian, S., Visintine, B., Siddharthan, R.V., and Thyagarajan, S. (2016). Pavement 1.

        "content": "Ultrasonic Surface Wave (USW) Target of Investigation Regarding concrete pavement, ultrasonic surface wave (USW) testing has the following applications: (1) Measuring modulus of elasticity of the concrete. (2) Estimating strength of concrete using the correlation between strength and modulus. (3) Indirectly assessing delamination, honeycombing, and debonding in the surface course material. (4) Assessing conditions of concrete for damage from various causes, including alkali\u2013silica reactions, fires, freeze\u2013thaw cycles, and other cracking processes. (5) USWs can also be used to evaluate asphalt pavements and overlays if the mix is cold and stiff. (6) Description The USW technique is an offshoot of the spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) method used in evaluating material properties (e.g., elastic moduli) in the area very near the surface. SASW uses surface-wave dispersion (i.e., velocity of propagation as a function of frequency and wavelength) in layered systems to obtain information about layer thickness and elastic moduli. (7) USW testing is identical to SASW testing except that the frequency range of interest is limited to a narrow high- frequency range in which the phase velocities of surface waves do not vary significantly with frequency. Using either the measured or assumed mass density and Poisson\u2019s ratio of the material, the phase velocity can be converted to the material modulus. A USW test consists of recording the response of the deck at two receiver locations from an impact on the surface of the deck. USW testing equipment is shown in figure 1. Source: FHWA. Figure 1. Photo. USW testing equipment.\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_6.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_8.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_10.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_12.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_14.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_16.png]\nThis photo shows ultrasonic surface wave testing equipment, which consists of three vertical, cylindrical objects and one metal box, all attached to two large, rounded, horizontal connecting bars. The two cylindrical objects closest to the box are receivers. The third cylindrical object on the right end of the connecting bar is an impact source. Cables run from the metal box to each of the cylindrical objects. Physical Principle Surface waves are elastic waves that travel along the free surface of a material and, in most cases, constitute the predominant proportion of energy in comparison to body waves, such as compressive waves (P-waves) and shear waves (S-waves). (7) The arrival of the surface (Rayleigh) wave follows the arrival of the two body-wave components because the surface wave is slower (figure 2). \u00a9 2011 Rutgers CAIT. Figure 2. Graph. Typical time record obtained from USW testing. (7) This graph is of a time record. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents amplitude. The plotted record has three labeled points. Closest to the y-axis, with the shortest time measurement, is point P (compression wave arrival). The next labeled point is S (shear wave arrival). The amplitude of the shear wave is higher than that of the compression wave. The furthest labeled point, and thus with the longest time measurement, is R (surface or Rayleigh wave arrival). The surface wave has the highest absolute peak amplitude of the three waves. Surface waves propagate radially from the impact source, forming a cylindrical front with a velocity dependent on the elastic properties of the medium. The waves propagating in a layered medium are dispersive; that is, waves of different wavelengths or frequencies travel with different velocities. Thus, information about the subsurface can be obtained by measuring the phase velocity versus frequency (dispersion curve) and backcalculating the dispersion curve to obtain the profile of the tested system (layer thickness and modulus). Surface-wave energy extends to a depth of approximately one wavelength. At wavelengths less than or equal to the thickness of the layer, the velocity of surface-wave propagation is more or less independent of wavelength (figure 3 and figure 4). Therefore, if the measurement is limited to wavelengths not exceeding the thickness of the surface course, the velocity of surface waves will be dependent only on the modulus of the surface course material. An average velocity is used for correlating to the material modulus. Significant variation in the phase velocity indicates the presence of delamination or another anomaly. (8)\n\u00a9 2011 N.

(7) This illustration is a schematic of ultrasonic surface wave testing. At the bottom of the illustration is a surface with an impact source on the left and two receivers to the right. Signals from the receivers rise to a display that shows the outputs, coherence and phase. A dispersion curve with wavelength versus phase velocity is then plotted, which, in turn, produces a Young\u2019s modulus profile plot of depth versus Young\u2019s modulus. The Young\u2019s modulus profile is approximately a vertical line and is described as \u201cWavelength considered less than layer thickness.\u201d Data Acquisition The basic components of USW equipment include a source, at least one pair of receivers, and a portable computer with data acquisition software. (4) USW equipment enables both automatic and semiautomatic data collection and processing. Figure 5 shows an example of a simple USW device (a portable seismic property analyzer) with a solenoid-type impact source and two receivers (accelerometers). Once the device is placed on the ground, a series of impacts from the source is detected by the receiver pair and recorded on a portable computer.\n> Source: FHWA. Figure 5. Photo.

USW testing using a portable seismic property analyzer in a cart. Data Processing Compressional waves arrive at the receivers first and are followed by shear waves and then surface waves. (3) However, more than two-thirds of the energy in the wave train is in the surface waves, making them more easily recorded. Figure 3 and figure 4 illustrate the data-processing procedure of SASW testing. A dynamic signal analyzer is used to transform the receiver outputs from the time domain to the frequency domain. The coherence function and phase difference between the two receivers are acquired. The coherence function is a measure of the degree by which the signals are linearly correlated. The cross-power spectrum is used to obtain the relative phase shift between two signals (two-channel recorder). The received signals are processed, and a subsequent calculation scheme is used to calculate the modulus directly in the field (figure 6).\nSource: FHWA.A. Raw data. This screenshot shows raw data from the impactor and two receivers. Three curves represent time history data from the impact, receiver 1, and receiver 2. Source: FHWA.B. Processed data. Figure 6. Screenshots. Raw and processed data during data collection. This screenshot shows a display from the testing device\u2019s computer screen for processed data and contains two charts. The x-axis of the main chart is modulus in kilopounds per square inch, and the y-axis of the main chart is depth in inches. Dots represent the modulus at different depths, and a line represents the average of the modulus. The x-axis of the small chart is frequency, and the y-axis of the small chart is phase. Phase information for signals from the receivers is shown in the small chart at the bottom. Data Interpretation Data from USW testing are typically presented in terms of concrete modulus distribution (figure 7). A very low modulus often indicates low-quality material or the presence of delamination or cracking and does not necessarily represent the actual concrete modulus at the test location.\nSource: FHWA.1 inch = 2.54 cm; 1 ksi = 6.9 mPa.

The x-axis is labeled \u201cLongitudinal distance\u201d and ranges from 8 to 112 inches. The y- axis is labeled \u201cLateral distance\u201d and ranges from 4 to 36 inches. To the right of the graph is the color scale of the modulus in kilopounds per square inch. The scale ranges from 1,500 to 5,000 kilopounds per square inch.

Advantages Advantages of USW testing include the following: Repeatability. Determination of modulus of material for appropriate design. Limitations Limitations of USW testing include the following: Slow data collection. Road and bridge closures necessary for surveying existing pavements. Expertise and training required for equipment setup and data collection, processing, and interpretation. Complicated backcalculation for multilayer systems. Limited ability to provide the degree of severity. Inability to measure pavement condition below the top of the discontinuity. (6) References Olson Engineering.

        "content": "Ultrasonic Tomography (UST) Target of Investigation UPE method is primarily used to inspect interiors of concrete structural members and tunnel linings for the following applications: Measuring thickness of concrete members. Detecting voids in grouted tendon ducts. Detecting poor bonding or debonding of overlays and repairs. Detecting delaminations. Detecting voids and honeycombing in concrete members. Locating ducts and reinforcement in concrete structures, like rebars, strands, and tendons. Quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) during construction of reinforced and prestressed concrete elements. Detecting voids behind tunnel linings and below slabs on grade. Description The UPE method involves using dry contact transmitting and receiving ultrasonic transducers in a \u201cpitch-catch\u201d configuration which emit shear waves into the concrete and detect and record reflections from objects of different acoustic impedances. UPE equipment is available in different sizes, varying from two transducers to a large number of transducers in an array arrangement (figure 1). Some systems use multiple transducers to serve as transmitters and receivers to accelerate the ultrasonic data acquisition, enhance the signal to noise ratio, and minimize effects of wave scattering from aggregate particles and similar inhomogeneities in concrete structures. Such systems with a large number of transducers are used for ultrasonic tomography. (1) A device known as MIRA, with an array of forty-eight low-frequency broadband shear transducers, is shown in figure 2. While one of the rows of transducers is acting as a transmitter, the remaining rows of transducers are acting as receivers. Each transducer is mechanically isolated and dampened independently that can fit the profile of a rough concrete testing surface.\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_1.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_2.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_3.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_4.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_5.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_6.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_9.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_10.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_11.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_12.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_13.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_14.png]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_15.jpeg]\n\n[IMAGE: page_1_img_17.png]\nFigure 1.

Six rows of transducers protrude from the bottom of a box mounted on the side of a cart with large wheels. The visible ends of the transducers are cylindrical. The transducers are a few inches above a concrete surface. Figure 2. Photo. Ultrasonic Tomographer. Ultrasonic Tomographer. The tomographer is rectangular. A rotating handle is mounted near each end. The underside of the tomographer has four rows of transducers, each row containing twelve transducers. The protruding ends of the transducers are cylindrical in shape. Physical Principle The UPE method involves generating and recording ultrasonic compression and shear waves being propagated through the surveyed object and reflected from objects of different acoustic impedances. As illustrated in figure 3, the transducer probe generates the wave field while the receiving probe detects and records the reflected waves. UPE testing defines the depth of the reflector (internal flaws such as cracking, voids, delamination, or horizontal cracking) by measuring the round trip travel time (\u0394t) of the pulse and using the wave propagation velocity (C) in the investigated material. (2) The calculation of depth (d) is illustrated in figure 4. Figure 3. Illustration. Ultrasonic Pulse Echo Physical Principle. Ultrasonic Pulse Echo Physical Principle. The two-dimensional schematic is a side view of a reflector object embedded in a portion of concrete deck. Two probes\u2014a transducer probe and a receiving probe\u2014are mounted on the upper surface of the deck. A descending arrow from the\ntransducer probe is reflected by the embedded object upwards to the receiving probe. The embedded object\u2019s depth in the deck is labeled d. Figure 4. Equation. Calculation of Depth of Reflector. Calculation of Depth of Reflector. Reflector depth, d, equals the product of the propagation velocity, C, times the quotient of the arrival time, delta t, divided by 2. When the transducers are enclosed in an array box (figure 1), the control unit in the antenna excites the first three rows of transducers, and the other rows of transducers act as receivers. In an ultrasonic tomography device with an array of forty-eight shear transducers, while one of the rows of transducers is acting as a transmitter, the remaining rows of transducers are acting as receivers. The ray paths for the measured transit time are shown in figure 5. This process is repeated until each of the rows of transducers has acted as transmitters. Figure 5. Illustration. Transmission and Reception of Shear Waves in Ultrasonic Tomography. Transmission and Reception of Shear Waves in Ultrasonic Tomography. The three-dimensional schematic has an array of transducers in a box resting on the upper surface of a concrete deck. Many ray paths extend downward from transmitting transducers into the deck and are reflected upward to transducers acting as receivers. In general, it is critical to have good coupling between the surface and the transducers. In the past, coupling was achieved by using coupling media. Some newer systems have the individual transducers spring loaded to conform to the surface and, thus, do not require any couplants. The nominal center frequency for units using shear waves is usually between 20 to 200 kHz. For most concrete applications, a center frequency of 50 kHz will yield better results. Data Acquisition\nThe UPE system consists of transducers, a portable computer with analysis software, and a data cable that connects the sensor unit to the portable computer. For ultrasonic tomography, the transducers and the electronics are mounted in a handheld box to be applied on concrete surfaces. Figure 6 shows data collection with an ultrasonic tomographer known as MIRA. While it is necessary to adapt test procedures to the needs of the desired application, the basic steps for different collection modes are described herein. Before the start of the actual testing, check the instrument settings by examining a few locations with known conditions. This is described as a review or explore mode. The actual testing should be conducted on a pre-defined grid to obtain a complete data set for the element surveyed. This is described as the map or scan mode. Figure 6. Photo. Data Collection Using Ultrasonic Tomographer. Data Collection Using Ultrasonic Tomographer. A worker is adjusting an ultrasonic tomographer on a bridge deck. The tomographer is a rectangular box with approximate dimensions of 1.5 feet, by 0.5 feet, by 0.5 feet. A handle is near each end of the instrument. The worker is bent over at the waist, grasping the handles. Data Processing After all the data are collected and stored, a data reconstruction calculation, Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT), is performed, resulting in a 3-D representation of the surveyed objects with features in the image indicating reflections from objects and discontinuities. In the 3-D volume, the position and strength of reflections from identified reflectors are presented by a color scheme and can be used to obtain the actual position and shape of the reflector. The 3-D volume can be examined by presenting various cutting vertical or horizontal planes. Images of detected features in three such planes, termed the B-scan, C-scan, and D-scan, are shown in figure 7. The B-scan is an image slice showing the depth of the specimen on the vertical (z) axis versus the width of scan on the horizontal (x) axis. This slice is a plane perpendicular to the scanning surface and parallel to the length of the device. The C-scan is an image slice showing the plan view of the tested area, with the vertical (y) axis of the scan depicting the width parallel to the scanning direction and the horizontal (x) axis of the scan, representing the length perpendicular to the scanning direction. The D-scan is\nlike the B-scan which images a plane perpendicular to the testing surface, but it is oriented parallel to the scanning direction. Figure 7. Illustration. B-scan, C-scan, and D-scan. B-scan, C-scan, and D-scan. The three-dimensional schematic has a rectangular scanning device containing an array of transducers and resting on a rectangular slab. Three arrows originate from a point beneath the scanning device. The arrows are axes, labeled x, y, and z. The x-axis and the y-axis are perpendicular to each other and parallel to, and rest on, the slab\u2019s upper surface. The x-axis extends diagonally to the right front of the image and is perpendicular to the scanning direction and parallel to the length of the scanning device. The y-axis extends diagonally to the left front of the image and is parallel to the scanning direction and perpendicular to the length of the scanning device. The z- axis extends downward into the slab and is perpendicular to the slab\u2019s upper surface and to the x-axis and the y-axis. A vertical slice of slab on the right and bordered by the x-axis and the z-axis is labeled B-scan. A vertical slice of slab on the left and bordered by the y-axis and the z-axis is labeled D-scan. A horizontal slice of slab within the slab is the plan view of the tested area and is labeled C-scan. Data Interpretation The 3-D visualization along with different plane sections (B-, C-, and D-scans) can be used to interpret the data. A color template is used to describe features depending on the strength of reflection of ultrasonic waves. In most cases, low reflectivity is described using cold colors (blues and greens), while high reflectivity is presented using hot colors (reds and yellows). High reflectivity will in most cases be an indication of presence of objects and discontinuities, like reinforcement, cracks, delaminations, and voids. Low reflectivity in most cases will represent a sound condition. Figure 8 shows a typical B-scan as viewed in the equipment display for several types of features and defects encountered during inspections.\nFigure 8. Composite Graph. Typical B-scans Showing Reinforcement, Backwall, Delamination, and Multiples. Typical B-scans Showing Reinforcement, Backwall, Delamination, and Multiples. The figure has two displays of B-scans as viewed in the Ultrasonic Pulse Echo equipment display. One display is on the left and the second display is on the right. Each display has a B-scan itself and data on the scan\u2019s x-axis and y-axis. The scans have a blue background and areas of green, yellow, and red. The B-scan on the left has a horizontal area of green, yellow, and red in the lower portion. The area is labeled Backwall. The scan has two smaller areas of green, yellow, and red in the upper portion. The two areas are labeled Reinforcement. The B-scan on the right has a small area of green, yellow, and red in the upper portion. The area is labeled Reinforcement. In the middle portion, the scan has a relatively large horizontal area of green, yellow, and mostly red. The area is labeled Delamination. In the bottom portion, the scan has a horizontal area of green. The area is labeled Multiple of delamination. The following are guidelines for interpreting data for common defects and features: Backwall (element thickness): Measuring the thickness of an element is based on the evaluation of the travel time of an ultrasonic wave reflected from the backwall. To get a clear reflection from the backwall, it is necessary to have a string contrast in acoustic impedances of the element material and material behind the backwall. Detecting the backwall of an element is illustrated in the left side of figure 8, identified by a high-amplitude reflection plotted in red. The horizontal shape of reflection is an indication of a constant thickness of the element. Reinforcement, conduit, tendons, etc.: Reinforcement, conduit, tendons, and other cable-like objects are identified as localized high-intensity reflections, as shown in figure 8. Similar to the backwall detection, there must be a contrast in acoustic impedances of concrete and the objects. The most effective way to detect the objects is by scanning perpendicular to the direction of their layout. A single scan will identify a linear object as a circular or oval high- amplitude (red) region. The position and orientation of a linear object is defined from numerous parallel scans across the object. It is generally not possible to identify the material type. Examining the phase of the reflection can provide some insight on whether the reflector is of acoustic impedance higher or lower than the surrounding concrete. Rebars are most commonly recognized by a regular spacing between the detected objects. Delamination: Similar to the backwall, delamination is identified as a high-amplitude linear reflection shallower than the backwall. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the position of the backwall. Since delamination is often a curved and inclined surface, it may appear as a linear object of a variable depth, as illustrated in figure 8. Since a delamination prevents propagation of an ultrasonic wave below it, the backwall is usually not visible at delamination locations. Instead, ultrasonic waves get confined between the delamination and the top surface, which may result in multiple equally-spaced reflections with depth in the B-scan. Air- and water-filled voids: Voids appear as high amplitude reflections of a finite size. Because both air- and water-filled voids are of a lower acoustic impedance than concrete, it is nearly impossible to determine whether the void is filled with water.\nA sample color-coded 3-D image of a surveyed element is presented in figure 9. The color scheme is scaled based on the intensity variations of the reflected shear waves received by the transducer array. With this intensity scaling, any discontinuities in hot color are readily apparent, with distinctively different wave speeds. Figure 9. Contour Map. Example of Measurements with Linear Array and 3-D Imaging with FAST. Example of Measurements with Linear Array and 3-D Imaging with FAST. Four separate images are contained in the figure. One of the images is three-dimensional and the others are two-dimensional. All of the images are in color with blue being the basic color, and red and yellow indicating greater intensity. Several large red areas are labeled Curved delaminations. Two areas of red and yellow are labeled Longitudinal reinforcement. Several small areas of red and yellow are labeled Hoop reinforcement. Advantages Reliable, repeatable, and consistent results. Easy field operation. Real-time data collection and processing. Additional benefits when using ultrasonic tomography array: Tomographic data present volumetric and informative image of the surveyed element. Requires low to medium level of expertise for equipment setup and data collection with modern equipment. Surface preparation not required because of dry point contact transducers. Limitations Time consuming and labor intensive. Low data collection speed. No discernible information deeper than the first air interface. Difficult to detect additional reinforcement below two layers of reinforcement. Requires considerable engineering judgment to properly evaluate a measurement. Possible misinterpretation when poor contact is made. References Kozlov, V.N., et. al., \u201cUltrasonic Equipment for Evaluation of Concrete Structures Based on 1.
